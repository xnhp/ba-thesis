In this paper we introduce a new variant of Cluster Editing whereby a vertex can be divided, or split, into two or more vertices thus allowing a single vertex to belong to multiple clusters. This new problem, Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting, has applications in finding correlation clusters in discrete data, including graphs obtained from Biological Network analysis. We initiate the study of this new problem and show that it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the total number of vertex splitting and edge editing operations.

While several GNN explanation methods have been proposed recently, there has been little to no work on theoretically analyzing the behavior of these methods or systematically evaluating their effectiveness. Here, we introduce the first axiomatic framework for theoretically analyzing, evaluating, and comparing state-of-the-art GNN explanation methods. We outline and formalize the key desirable properties that all GNN explanation methods should satisfy in order to generate reliable explanations, namely, faithfulness, stability, and fairness. We leverage these properties to present the first ever theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of state-of-the-art GNN explanation methods. Our analysis establishes upper bounds on all the aforementioned properties for popular GNN explanation methods. We also leverage our framework to empirically evaluate these methods on multiple real-world datasets from diverse domains. Our empirical results demonstrate that some popular GNN explanation methods (e.g., gradient-based methods) perform no better than a random baseline and that methods which leverage the graph structure are more effective than those that solely rely on the node features.},

It has become critical to explore how machine learning and specifically deep learning methods can be exploited to analyse healthcare data. A major limitation of existing methods has been the focus on grid-like data; however, the structure of physiological recordings are often irregular and unordered which makes it difficult to conceptualise them as a matrix. As such, graph neural networks have attracted significant attention by exploiting implicit information that resides in a biological system, with interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights can be either temporal associations or anatomical junctions. In this survey, we thoroughly review the different types of graph architectures and their applications in healthcare. We provide an overview of these methods in a systematic manner, organized by their domain of application including functional connectivity, anatomical structure and electrical-based analysis. We also outline the limitations of existing techniques and discuss potential directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Spectral clustering is a celebrated algorithm that partitions objects based on pairwise similarity information. While this approach has been successfully applied to a variety of domains, it comes with limitations. The reason is that there are many other applications in which only \textbackslash emph\{multi\}-way similarity measures are available. This motivates us to explore the multi-way measurement setting. In this work, we develop two algorithms intended for such setting: Hypergraph Spectral Clustering (HSC) and Hypergraph Spectral Clustering with Local Refinement (HSCLR). Our main contribution lies in performance analysis of the poly-time algorithms under a random hypergraph model, which we name the weighted stochastic block model, in which objects and multi-way measures are modeled as nodes and weights of hyperedges, respectively. Denoting by \$n\$ the number of nodes, our analysis reveals the following: (1) HSC outputs a partition which is better than a random guess if the sum of edge weights (to be explained later) is \$\textbackslash Omega(n)\$; (2) HSC outputs a partition which coincides with the hidden partition except for a vanishing fraction of nodes if the sum of edge weights is \$\textbackslash omega(n)\$; and (3) HSCLR exactly recovers the hidden partition if the sum of edge weights is on the order of \$n \textbackslash log n\$. Our results improve upon the state of the arts recently established under the model and they firstly settle the order-wise optimal results for the binary edge weight case. Moreover, we show that our results lead to efficient sketching algorithms for subspace clustering, a computer vision application. Lastly, we show that HSCLR achieves the information-theoretic limits for a special yet practically relevant model, thereby showing no computational barrier for the case.},

Our understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperation phenomena among cell populations is unfortunately quite limited, without a mature single cell metabolomics technology. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely scFEA (single cell Flux Estimation Analysis), to infer single cell fluxome from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a comprehensively reorganized human metabolic map as focused metabolic modules, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multi-layer neural networks to fully capitulate the non-linear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq dataset with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this dataset demonstrated the consistency between predicted flux and metabolic imbalance with the observed variation of metabolites in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on publicly available single cell melanoma and head and neck cancer datasets, and discovered different metabolic landscapes between cancer and stromal cells. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analysis including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Classification of a pairwise alignment of two sequences into positive and negative classes corresponds to the clustering of the input sequences. After we combined the distributed representation of RNA nucleotides with the secondary-structure information specific to ncRNAs and furthermore with mapping profiles of next-generation sequence reads, the training of CNNs for classification of alignments of RNA sequences yielded accurate clustering in terms of ncRNA families and outperformed the existing clustering methods for ncRNA sequences. Several interesting sequence motifs and secondary-structure motifs known for the snoRNA family and specific to microRNA and tRNA families were identified.The source code of our CNN software in the deep-learning framework Chainer is available at http://www.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/cnn/, and the dataset used for performance evaluation in this work is available at the same URL.},

  abstract = {Graphs are the most ubiquitous form of structured data representation used in machine learning. They model, however, only pairwise relations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order relations found in many real-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges. Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph’s expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information. Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach, inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation, we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on representative benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the higher expressive power of HyperSAGE makes it more stable in learning node representations as compared to the alternatives.},

We have proposed Louvain-AND-Attribute (LAA) and Louvain-OR-Attribute (LOA) methods to analyze the effect of using node attributes with modularity. We compared this approach with existing community detection approaches using different datasets. We found the performance of both algorithms better than Newman’s Eigenvector method in achieving modularity and relatively good results of gain in modularity in LAA than LOA. We used density, internal and external edge density for the evaluation of quality of detected communities. LOA provided highly dense partitions in the network as compared to Louvain and Eigenvector algorithms and close values to Clauset. Moreover, LOA achieved few numbers of edges between communities.},

Most of those algorithms have assumed pairwise relationships of objects of interest. However, in many real applications, the relationships between objects are in higher-order, beyond a pairwise formulation. To efficiently learn deep embeddings on the high-order graph-structured data, we introduce two end-to-end trainable operators to the family of graph neural networks, i.e., hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention. Whilst hypergraph convolution defines the basic formulation of performing convolution on a hypergraph, hypergraph attention further enhances the capacity of representation learning by leveraging an attention module. With the two operators, a graph neural network is readily extended to a more flexible model and applied to diverse applications where non-pairwise relationships are observed. Extensive experimental results with semi-supervised node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks are able to achieve promising performance on multiple graph downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Comparatively lesser work has been done to design graph neural networks (GNNs) which can operate directly for community detection in a graph. Traditionally, GNNs are trained on a semi-supervised or self-supervised loss function and then clustering algorithms are applied to detect communities. However, such decoupled approaches are inherently sub-optimal. Design of an unsupervised community detection loss function to train a GNN is a fundamental challenge to propose an integrated solution. To tackle this problem, we combine the principle of self-expressiveness with the framework of self-supervised graph neural network for unsupervised community detection for the first time in the literature. To improve the scalability of the approach, we propose a randomly sampled batch-wise training and use the principle of self-expressiveness to generate a subset of strong node similarity / dissimilarity values. These values are used to regularize the node communities obtained from a self-supervised graph neural network. Our solution is trained in an end-to-end fashion. We are able to achieve state-of-the-art community detection results on multiple publicly available datasets.},

This unexpected universality suggests that similar laws govern the development and function of most complex networks in nature.Providing that sufficient formalism will be developed this new conceptual framework could potentially revolutionize our view and practice of molecular cell biology.},

Network-based approaches have potential biological and clinical applications, from the identification of disease genes to better drug targets.Whereas essential genes tend to be associated with hubs, or highly connected proteins, disease genes tend to segregate at the network's functional periphery, avoiding hubs.Disease genes have a high propensity to interact with each other, forming disease modules. The identification of these disease modules can help us to identify disease pathways and predict other disease genes.The highly interconnected nature of the interactome means that, at the molecular level, it is difficult to consider diseases as being independent of one another. The mapping of network-based dependencies between pathophenotypes has culminated in the concept of the diseasome, which represents disease maps whose nodes are diseases and whose links represent various molecular relationships between the disease-associated cellular components.Diseases linked at the molecular level tend to show detectable comorbidity.Network medicine has important applications to drug design, leading to the emergence of network pharmacology, and also in disease classification.},

This article studies the problem of prediction of classes of metabolic pathways (series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell) in which a given biochemical compound participates. We apply a hybrid machine learning approach consisting of graph convolutional networks used to extract molecular shape features as input to a random forest classifier. In contrast to previously applied machine learning methods for this problem, our framework automatically extracts relevant shape features directly from input SMILES representations, which are atom-bond specifications of chemical structures composing the molecules. RESULTS: Our method is capable of correctly predicting the respective metabolic pathway class of 95.16\% of tested compounds, whereas competing methods only achieve an accuracy of 84.92\% or less. Furthermore, our framework extends to the task of classification of compounds having mixed membership in multiple pathway classes. Our prediction accuracy for this multi-label task is 97.61\%. We analyze the relative importance of various global physicochemical features to the pathway class prediction problem and show that simple linear/logistic regression models can predict the values of these global features from the shape features extracted using our framework.

Modern molecular biology techniques provide tools to alter plant oil compositions through bioengineering, however with few exceptions the final composition of triacylglycerol cannot be predicted. One reason for limited success in oilseed bioengineering is the inadequate understanding of how to control the flux of fatty acids through various fatty acid modification, and triacylglycerol assembly pathways of the lipid metabolic network. This review focuses on the mechanisms of acyl flux through the lipid metabolic network, and highlights where uncertainty resides in our understanding of seed oil biosynthesis.

We show that our directional graph networks (DGNs) generalize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when applied on a grid. Whereas recent theoretical works focus on understanding local neighbourhoods, local structures and local isomorphism with no global information flow, our novel theoretical framework allows directional convolutional kernels in any graph. First, by defining a vector field in the graph, we develop a method of applying directional derivatives and smoothing by projecting node-specific messages into the field. Then we propose the use of the Laplacian eigenvectors as such vector field, and we show that the method generalizes CNNs on an n-dimensional grid, and is provably more discriminative than standard GNNs regarding the Weisfeiler-Lehman 1-WL test. Finally, we bring the power of CNN data augmentation to graphs by providing a means of doing reflection, rotation and distortion on the underlying directional field. We evaluate our method on different standard benchmarks and see a relative error reduction of 8\textbackslash\% on the CIFAR10 graph dataset and 11\% to 32\% on the molecular ZINC dataset. An important outcome of this work is that it enables to translate any physical or biological problems with intrinsic directional axes into a graph network formalism with an embedded directional field.},

This method is based on Chromosome Conformation Capture, in which chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, then digested, and re-ligated in such a way that only DNA fragments that are covalently linked together form ligation products. The ligation products contain the information of not only where they originated from in the genomic sequence but also where they reside, physically, in the 3D organization of the genome. In Hi-C, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions followed by deep sequencing. The compatibility of Hi-C with next generation sequencing platforms makes it possible to detect chromatin interactions on an unprecedented scale. This advance gives Hi-C the power to both explore the biophysical properties of chromatin as well as the implications of chromatin structure for the biological functions of the nucleus. A massively parallel survey of chromatin interaction provides the previously missing dimension of spatial context to other genomic studies. This spatial context will provide a new perspective to studies of chromatin and its role in genome regulation in normal conditions and in disease.},

SBGN aims at representing networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way to foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, storage, exchange, and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling. SBGN is defined neutrally to programming languages and software encoding; however, it is oriented primarily towards allowing models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language. The notable changes from the previous version include the addition of attributes for better specify metadata about maps, as well as support for multiple maps, sub-maps, colors, and annotations. These changes enable a more efficient exchange of data to other commonly used systems biology formats (e.~g., BioPAX and SBML) and between tools supporting SBGN (e.~g., CellDesigner, Newt, Krayon, SBGN-ED, STON, cd2sbgnml, and MINERVA). More details on SBGN and related software are available at               http://sbgn.org               .

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {Spectral clustering (SC) is a popular clustering technique to find strongly connected communities on a graph. SC can be used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to implement pooling operations that aggregate nodes belonging to the same cluster. However, the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian is expensive and, since clustering results are graph-specific, pooling methods based on SC must perform a new optimization for each new sample. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering approach that addresses these limitations of SC. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem and train a GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this objective. Our GNN-based implementation is differentiable, does not require to compute the spectral decomposition, and learns a clustering function that can be quickly evaluated on out-of-sample graphs. From the proposed clustering method, we design a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of state-of-the-art graph pooling techniques and achieves the best performance in several supervised and unsupervised tasks.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links.

  abstract = {The pairwise interaction paradigm of graph machine learning has predominantly governed the modelling of relational systems. However, graphs alone cannot capture the multi-level interactions present in many complex systems and the expressive power of such schemes was proven to be limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message Passing Simplicial Networks (MPSNs), a class of models that perform message passing on simplicial complexes (SCs) – topological objects generalising graphs to higher dimensions. To theoretically analyse the expressivity of our model we introduce a Simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) colouring procedure for distinguishing non-isomorphic SCs. We relate the power of SWL to the problem of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs and show that SWL and MPSNs are strictly more powerful than the WL test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test. We deepen the analysis by comparing our model with traditional graph neural networks with ReLU activations in terms of the number of linear regions of the functions they can represent. We empirically support our theoretical claims by showing that MPSNs can distinguish challenging strongly regular graphs for which GNNs fail and, when equipped with orientation equivariant layers, they can improve classification accuracy in oriented SCs compared to a GNN baseline. Additionally, we implement a library for message passing on simplicial complexes that we envision to release in due course.},

  abstract = {Drug discovery and development is an extremely complex process, with high attrition contributing to the costs of delivering new medicines to patients. Recently, various machine learning approaches have been proposed and investigated to help improve the effectiveness and speed of multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Among these techniques, it is especially those using Knowledge Graphs that are proving to have considerable promise across a range of tasks, including drug repurposing, drug toxicity prediction and target gene-disease prioritisation. In such a knowledge graph-based representation of drug discovery domains, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities or vertices, whilst relationships or edges between them indicate some level of interaction. For example, an edge between a disease and drug entity might represent a successful clinical trial, or an edge between two drug entities could indicate a potentially harmful interaction. In order to construct high-quality and ultimately informative knowledge graphs however, suitable data and information is of course required. In this review, we detail publicly available primary data sources containing information suitable for use in constructing various drug discovery focused knowledge graphs. We aim to help guide machine learning and knowledge graph practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. Overall we hope this review will help motivate more machine learning researchers to explore combining knowledge graphs and machine learning to help solve key and emerging questions in the drug discovery domain.},

  abstract = {Relationship between agents can be conveniently represented by graphs. When these relationships have different modalities, they are better modelled by multilayer graphs where each layer is associated with one modality. Such graphs arise naturally in many contexts including biological and social networks. Clustering is a fundamental problem in network analysis where the goal is to regroup nodes with similar connectivity profiles. In the past decade, various clustering methods have been extended from the unilayer setting to multilayer graphs in order to incorporate the information provided by each layer. While most existing works assume - rather restrictively - that all layers share the same set of nodes, we propose a new framework that allows for layers to be defined on different sets of nodes. In particular, the nodes not recorded in a layer are treated as missing. Within this paradigm, we investigate several generalizations of well-known clustering methods in the complete setting to the incomplete one and prove some consistency results under the Multi-Layer Stochastic Block Model assumption. Our theoretical results are complemented by thorough numerical comparisons between our proposed algorithms on synthetic data, and also on real datasets, thus highlighting the promising behaviour of our methods in various settings.},

Analysis and handling of such data is becoming one of the major bottlenecks in the utilization of the technology. The raw microarray data are images, which have to be transformed into gene expression matrices – tables where rows represent genes, columns represent various samples such as tissues or experimental conditions, and numbers in each cell characterize the expression level of the particular gene in the particular sample. These matrices have to be analyzed further, if any knowledge about the underlying biological processes is to be extracted. In this paper we concentrate on discussing bioinformatics methods used for such analysis. We briefly discuss supervised and unsupervised data analysis and its applications, such as predicting gene function classes and cancer classification. Then we discuss how the gene expression matrix can be used to predict putative regulatory signals in the genome sequences. In conclusion we discuss some possible future directions.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

In this paper, we build upon previous results \textbackslash cite\{oono2019graph\} to further analyze the over-smoothing effect in the general graph neural network architecture. We show when the weight matrix satisfies the conditions determined by the spectrum of augmented normalized Laplacian, the Dirichlet energy of embeddings will converge to zero, resulting in the loss of discriminative power. Using Dirichlet energy to measure "expressiveness" of embedding is conceptually clean; it leads to simpler proofs than \textbackslash cite\{oono2019graph\} and can handle more non-linearities.},

Current GNN designing works depend on immense human expertise to explore different message-passing mechanisms, and require manual enumeration to determine the proper message-passing depth. Inspired by the strong searching capability of neural architecture search (NAS) in CNN, this paper proposes Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) with novel-designed search space. The GNAS can automatically learn better architecture with the optimal depth of message passing on the graph. Specifically, we design Graph Neural Architecture Paradigm (GAP) with tree-topology computation procedure and two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering and neighbor aggregation) from message-passing mechanism to construct powerful graph network search space. Feature filtering performs adaptive feature selection, and neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighbors' statistics. Experiments show that our GNAS can search for better GNNs with multiple message-passing mechanisms and optimal message-passing depth. The searched network achieves remarkable improvement over state-of-the-art manual designed and search-based GNNs on five large-scale datasets at three classical graph tasks.

  abstract = {Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) are ubiquitous in our daily life, as they can describe complex interactions among various types of objects. Heterogeneous information network embedding aims to project the network elements of HINs into low-dimensional node representation vectors, which can facilitate effective analyze of HINs. To learn appropriate HIN embeddings, most existing methods usually adopt meta-paths to capture the heterogeneous semantic information, which require domain knowledge and trial-and-error to find suitable meta-paths. Besides, most existing methods fail to preserve high-order local structural information, and pay little attention to the implicit semantics in HINs. In this paper, we propose a local structural aware heterogeneous information network embedding model named LSA-HNE. Specifically, we first design a relational self-attention graph neural network model to aggregate heterogeneous information and automatically extract semantic similarity without using meta-paths. In addition, we employ a biased random walk based sampling method to extract the local structural information and preserve the implicit semantics in HINs. The experiments conducted on four real-world datasets show that our proposed model is effective compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

This provides additional information about the structural properties of a node, which the standard convolution operation in a GCN can then leverage for obtaining potentially improved effectiveness in a down-stream task. Our experiments demonstrate that adding these node interaction patterns (NIPs) along with an additional noise-contrastive pairwise document similarity objective within a GCN improves the linked document classification task.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance on a wide range of graph-based tasks. Despite their success, one severe limitation of GNNs is the over-smoothing issue (indistinguishable representations of nodes in different classes). In this work, we present a systematic and quantitative study on the over-smoothing issue of GNNs. First, we introduce two quantitative metrics, MAD and MADGap, to measure the smoothness and oversmoothness of the graph nodes representations, respectively. Then, we verify that smoothing is the nature of GNNs and the critical factor leading to over-smoothness is the low information-to-noise ratio of the message received by the nodes, which is partially determined by the graph topology. Finally, we propose two methods to alleviate the oversmoothing issue from the topological view: (1) MADReg which adds a MADGap-based regularizer to the training objective; (2) AdaEdge which optimizes the graph topology based on the model predictions. Extensive experiments on 7 widely-used graph datasets with 10 typical GNN models show that the two proposed methods are effective for relieving the over-smoothing issue, thus improving the performance of various GNN models.},

  abstract = {Background Contemporary deep learning approaches show cutting-edge performance in a variety of complex prediction tasks. Nonetheless, the application of deep learning in healthcare remains limited since deep learning methods are often considered as non-interpretable black-box models. However, the machine learning community made recent elaborations on interpretability methods explaining data point-specific decisions of deep learning techniques. We believe that such explanations can assist the need in personalized precision medicine decisions via explaining patient-specific predictions. Methods Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a technique to explain decisions of deep learning methods. It is widely used to interpret Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied on image data. Recently, CNNs started to extend towards non-Euclidean domains like graphs. Molecular networks are commonly represented as graphs detailing interactions between molecules. Gene expression data can be assigned to the vertices of these graphs. In other words, gene expression data can be structured by utilizing molecular network information as prior knowledge. Graph-CNNs can be applied to structured gene expression data, for example, to predict metastatic events in breast cancer. Therefore, there is a need for explanations showing which part of a molecular network is relevant for predicting an event, e.g., distant metastasis in cancer, for each individual patient. Results We extended the procedure of LRP to make it available for Graph-CNN and tested its applicability on a large breast cancer dataset. We present Graph Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (GLRP) as a new method to explain the decisions made by Graph-CNNs. We demonstrate a sanity check of the developed GLRP on a hand-written digits dataset and then apply the method on gene expression data. We show that GLRP provides patient-specific molecular subnetworks that largely agree with clinical knowledge and identify common as well as novel, and potentially druggable, drivers of tumor progression. Conclusions The developed method could be potentially highly useful on interpreting classification results in the context of different omics data and prior knowledge molecular networks on the individual patient level, as for example in precision medicine approaches or a molecular tumor board.

  abstract = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy—using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

Its inception has allowed models to achieve state-of-the-art performance for challenging tasks such as link prediction, rating prediction, and node clustering. However, a fundamental flaw exists in Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based approaches. Specifically, merely minimizing the loss of VAE increases the deviation from its primary objective. Focusing on Variational Graph Autoencoder for Community Detection (VGAECD) we found that optimizing the loss using the stochastic gradient descent often leads to sub-optimal community structure especially when initialized poorly. We address this shortcoming by introducing a dual optimization procedure. This procedure aims to guide the optimization process and encourage learning of the primary objective. Additionally, we linearize the encoder to reduce the number of learning parameters. The outcome is a robust algorithm that outperforms its predecessor.},

  abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental problem in social network analysis consisting in unsupervised dividing social actors (nodes in a social graph) with certain social connections (edges in a social graph) into densely knitted and highly related groups with each group well separated from the others. Classical approaches for community detection usually deal only with network structure and ignore features of its nodes (called node attributes), although many real-world social networks provide additional actors' information such as interests. It is believed that the attributes may clarify and enrich the knowledge about the actors and give sense to the communities. This belief has motivated the progress in developing community detection methods that use both the structure and the attributes of network (i.e. deal with a node-attributed graph) to yield more informative and qualitative results.  During the last decade many such methods based on different ideas have appeared. Although there exist partial overviews of them, a recent survey is a necessity as the growing number of the methods may cause repetitions in methodology and uncertainty in practice.  In this paper we aim at describing and clarifying the overall situation in the field of community detection in node-attributed social networks. Namely, we perform an exhaustive search of known methods and propose a classification of them based on when and how structure and attributes are fused. We not only give a description of each class but also provide general technical ideas behind each method in the class. Furthermore, we pay attention to available information which methods outperform others and which datasets and quality measures are used for their evaluation. Basing on the information collected, we make conclusions on the current state of the field and disclose several problems that seem important to be resolved in future.},

  abstract = {The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m \textasciitilde{} n and d \textasciitilde{} log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log\^2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

  abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive empirical advancement across a wide variety of graph-related applications. Despite their great success, training GCNs on large graphs suffers from computational and memory issues. A potential path to circumvent these obstacles is sampling-based methods, where at each layer a subset of nodes is sampled. Although recent studies have empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of sampling-based methods, these works lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic settings and cannot fully leverage the information of evolving parameters during optimization. In this paper, we describe and analyze a general \textbackslash textbf\{\textbackslash textit\{doubly variance reduction\}\} schema that can accelerate any sampling method under the memory budget. The motivating impetus for the proposed schema is a careful analysis for the variance of sampling methods where it is shown that the induced variance can be decomposed into node embedding approximation variance (\textbackslash emph\{zeroth-order variance\}) during forward propagation and layerwise-gradient variance (\textbackslash emph\{first-order variance\}) during backward propagation. We theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed schema and show that it enjoys an \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(1/T)\$ convergence rate. We complement our theoretical results by integrating the proposed schema in different sampling methods and applying them to different large real-world graphs.

Recent work on their expressive power has focused on isomorphism tasks and countable feature spaces. We extend this theoretical framework to include continuous features—which occur regularly in real-world input domains and within the hidden layers of GNNs—and we demonstrate the requirement for multiple aggregation functions in this context. Accordingly, we propose Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA), a novel architecture combining multiple aggregators with degree-scalers (which generalize the sum aggregator). Finally, we compare the capacity of different models to capture and exploit the graph structure via a novel benchmark containing multiple tasks taken from classical graph theory, alongside existing benchmarks from realworld domains, all of which demonstrate the strength of our model. With this work, we hope to steer some of the GNN research towards new aggregation methods which we believe are essential in the search for powerful and robust models.},

Here, we show that the combination of machine learning and abundant multiomics data (proteomics and metabolomics) can be used to effectively predict pathway dynamics in an automated fashion. The new method outperforms a classical kinetic model, and produces qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be used to productively guide bioengineering efforts. This method systematically leverages arbitrary amounts of new data to improve predictions, and does not assume any particular interactions, but rather implicitly chooses the most predictive ones.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Link prediction in biomedical graphs has several important applications including predicting Drug-Target Interactions (DTI), Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) prediction and Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). It can be done using a classifier to output the probability of link formation between nodes. Recently several works have used neural networks to create node representations which allow rich inputs to neural classifiers. Preliminary works were done on this and report promising results. However they did not use realistic settings like time-slicing, evaluate performances with comprehensive metrics or explain when or why neural network methods outperform. We investigated how inputs from four node representation algorithms affect performance of a neural link predictor on random- and time-sliced biomedical graphs of real-world sizes (∼\,6 million edges) containing information relevant to DTI, PPI and LBD. We compared the performance of the neural link predictor to those of established baselines and report performance across five metrics. RESULTS: In random- and time-sliced experiments when the neural network methods were able to learn good node representations and there was a negligible amount of disconnected nodes, those approaches outperformed the baselines. In the smallest graph (∼\,15,000 edges) and in larger graphs with approximately 14\% disconnected nodes, baselines such as Common Neighbours proved a justifiable choice for link prediction. At low recall levels (∼\,0.3) the approaches were mostly equal, but at higher recall levels across all nodes and average performance at individual nodes, neural network approaches were superior. Analysis showed that neural network methods performed well on links between nodes with no previous common neighbours; potentially the most interesting links. Additionally, while neural network methods benefit from large amounts of data, they require considerable amounts of computational resources to utilise them. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that when there is enough data for the neural network methods to use and there are a negligible amount of disconnected nodes, those approaches outperform the baselines. At low recall levels the approaches are mostly equal but at higher recall levels and average performance at individual nodes, neural network approaches are superior. Performance at nodes without common neighbours which indicate more unexpected and perhaps more useful links account for this.},

  abstract = {Attributed graph embedding, which learns vector representations from graph topology and node features, is a challenging task for graph analysis. Recently, methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have made great progress on this task. However, existing GCN-based methods have three major drawbacks. Firstly, our experiments indicate that the entanglement of graph convolutional filters and weight matrices will harm both the performance and robustness. Secondly, we show that graph convolutional filters in these methods reveal to be special cases of generalized Laplacian smoothing filters, but they do not preserve optimal low-pass characteristics. Finally, the training objectives of existing algorithms are usually recovering the adjacency matrix or feature matrix, which are not always consistent with real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Graph Encoder (AGE), a novel attributed graph embedding framework. AGE consists of two modules: (1) To better alleviate the high-frequency noises in the node features, AGE first applies a carefully-designed Laplacian smoothing filter. (2) AGE employs an adaptive encoder that iteratively strengthens the filtered features for better node embeddings. We conduct experiments using four public benchmark datasets to validate AGE on node clustering and link prediction tasks. Experimental results show that AGE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph embedding methods considerably on these tasks.},

The present review presents a state-of-the-art toolbox for plant metabolic network analysis. Among the described approaches are different in silico modeling techniques, including flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis and kinetic flux profiling, as well as different variants of experiments with plant systems which use radioactive and stable isotopes to determine in vivo plant metabolic fluxes. The fundamental principles of these techniques, the required data input and the obtained flux information are enriched by technical advices, specific to plants.

  abstract = {Cumulative experimental studies have demonstrated the critical roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the diverse fundamental and important biological processes, and in the development of numerous complex human diseases. Thus, exploring the relationships between miRNAs and diseases is helpful with understanding the mechanisms, the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of complex diseases. As the identification of miRNA-disease associations via traditional biological experiments is time-consuming and expensive, an effective computational prediction method is appealing. In this study, we present a deep learning framework with variational graph auto-encoder for miRNA-disease association prediction (VGAE-MDA). VGAE-MDA first gets the representations of miRNAs and diseases from the heterogeneous networks constructed by miRNA-miRNA similarity, disease-disease similarity, and known miRNA-disease associations. Then, VGAE-MDA constructs two sub-networks: miRNA-based network and disease-based network. Combining the representations based on the heterogeneous network, two variational graph auto-encoders (VGAE) are deployed for calculating the miRNA-disease association scores from two sub-networks, respectively. Lastly, VGAE-MDA obtains the final predicted association score for a miRNA-disease pair by integrating the scores from these two trained networks. Unlike the previous model, the VGAE-MDA can mitigate the effect of noises from random selection of negative samples. Besides, the use of graph convolutional neural (GCN) network can naturally incorporate the node features from the graph structure while the variational autoencoder (VAE) makes use of latent variables to predict associations from the perspective of data distribution. The experimental results show that VGAE-MDA outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in miRNA-disease association prediction. Besides, the effectiveness of our model has been further demonstrated by case studies.},

This contribution presents the visualization tool Omix, an editor for metabolic network diagrams and a customizable visualization framework. As an outstanding feature, data visualization is script-based. The dedicated new scripting language OVL (Omix Visualization Language) enables the user to freely design the manner data is visualized in the network. An intuitive user interface, several newly developed, domain-specific drawing automatisms as well as visualization concepts make the software Omix a mature computational tool supporting the specific requirements of researchers from systems biology and life science domains as will be demonstrated on several application examples.},

  abstract = {In the living cell, biochemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes are the drivers for metabolic processes like growth, energy production, and replication. Metabolic networks are the representation of these processes describing the complex interactions of biochemical compounds. The large amount of manifold data concerning metabolic networks continually arising from current research activities in biotechnology leads to the great challenge of information visualization. Visualizing information in networks first of all requires appropriate network diagrams. In the context of metabolic networks, historical conventions regarding the network layout have been established. These layouts are not realizable by prevailing algorithms for automatic graph drawing. Hence, manual graph drawing is the predominating way to set up metabolic network diagrams. This is very time-consuming without software support, especially considering large networks with more than 500 nodes. We present a semi-automatic approach to drawing networks which relies on manual editing supported by two concepts of the interactive and automatic arrangement of nodes and edges. The first concept, called the layout pattern, uses an arbitrarily shaped skeleton as a backbone for the arrangement of nodes and edges. The second concept allows us to wrap a set of repeating drawing steps onto a so-called motif stamp, which can be appended to other parts of a diagram during the drawing process. Finally, a case study demonstrates that both semi-automatic drawing techniques diminish the time to be devoted for the manual network drawing process.},

Results: Protein interaction graphs were separated into subgraphs of interconnected proteins, using the JUNG implementation of Girvan and Newman's Edge-Betweenness algorithm. Functions were sought for these subgraphs by detecting significant correlations with the distribution of Gene Ontology terms which had been used to annotate the proteins within each cluster. The method was implemented using freely available software (JUNG and the R statistical package). Protein clusters with significant correlations to functional annotations could be identified and included groups of proteins know to cooperate in cell metabolism. The method appears to be resilient against the presence of false positive interactions. Conclusion: This method provides a useful tool for rapid screening of small to medium size protein interaction datasets.},

As the field grows, it becomes critical to identify key architectures and validate new ideas that generalize to larger, more complex datasets. Unfortunately, it has been increasingly difficult to gauge the effectiveness of new models in the absence of a standardized benchmark with consistent experimental settings. In this paper, we introduce a reproducible GNN benchmarking framework, with the facility for researchers to add new models conveniently for arbitrary datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by presenting a principled investigation into the recent Weisfeiler-Lehman GNNs (WL-GNNs) compared to message passing-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for a variety of graph tasks, i.e. graph regression/classification and node/link prediction, with medium-scale datasets.},

  abstract = {The stoichiometric matrix, S, represents a mapping of reaction rate vectors into a space of concentration time derivatives. The left null space of the stoichiometric matrix contains the dynamic invariants: a combination of concentration variables, referred to as metabolic pools, whose total concentration does not change over time. By analogy to the traditional reaction map formed by S, a compound map can be derived from −ST. The analogy to flux analysis of the (right) null space of S enables us to classify the metabolic pools into three categories: Type A that contains chemical elements and their combinations in the form of certain moieties, Type B that contains such moieties in addition to cofactors carrying such moieties that are internal to the network, and Type C that contains only the cofactors. A convex formulation of the basis for the left null space allows us to directly classify the metabolic pools into these three categories. Type B metabolic pools include conservation pools that form conjugates of moiety-occupied and moiety-vacant concentration states of metabolites and cofactors. Type B metabolic pools thus describe the various states of moiety exchange between the primary substrates and the cofactors that capture properties like energy and redox potential. The convex basis gives clear insight into this exchange for glycolytic pathway in human red blood cell, including the identification of high and low energy pools that form conjugates. Examples suggest that pool maps may be more appropriate for signaling pathways than flux maps. The analysis of the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix allows us to define the achievable states of the cell and their physiological relevance.},

Recently a few researchers attempted to incorporate nonlinear techniques into matrix completion but there still exists considerable limitations. In this paper, a novel method called deep matrix factorization (DMF) is proposed for nonlinear matrix completion. Different from conventional matrix completion methods that are based on linear latent variable models, DMF is on the basis of a nonlinear latent variable model. DMF is formulated as a deep-structure neural network, in which the inputs are the low-dimensional unknown latent variables and the outputs are the partially observed variables. In DMF, the inputs and the parameters of the multilayer neural network are simultaneously optimized to minimize the reconstruction errors for the observed entries. Then the missing entries can be readily recovered by propagating the latent variables to the output layer. DMF is compared with state-of-the-art methods of linear and nonlinear matrix completion in the tasks of toy matrix completion, image inpainting and collaborative filtering. The experimental results verify that DMF is able to provide higher matrix completion accuracy than existing methods do and DMF is applicable to large matrices.},

Confronting the challenges of learning representation for complex data in real practice, we propose to incorporate such data structure in a hypergraph, which is more flexible on data modeling, especially when dealing with complex data. In this method, a hyperedge convolution operation is designed to handle the data correlation during representation learning. In this way, traditional hypergraph learning procedure can be conducted using hyperedge convolution operations efficiently. HGNN is able to learn the hidden layer representation considering the high-order data structure, which is a general framework considering the complex data correlations. We have conducted experiments on citation network classification and visual object recognition tasks and compared HGNN with graph convolutional networks and other traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HGNN method outperforms recent state-of-theart methods. We can also reveal from the results that the proposed HGNN is superior when dealing with multi-modal data compared with existing methods.},

  abstract = {Population-scale genomic data sets have given researchers incredible amounts of information from which to infer evolutionary histories. Concomitant with this flood of data, theoretical and methodological advances have sought to extract information from genomic sequences to infer demographic events such as population size changes and gene flow among closely related populations/species, construct recombination maps, and uncover loci underlying recent adaptation. To date, most methods make use of only one or a few summaries of the input sequences and therefore ignore potentially useful information encoded in the data. The most sophisticated of these approaches involve likelihood calculations, which require theoretical advances for each new problem, and often focus on a single aspect of the data (e.g., only allele frequency information) in the interest of mathematical and computational tractability. Directly interrogating the entirety of the input sequence data in a likelihood-free manner would thus offer a fruitful alternative. Here, we accomplish this by representing DNA sequence alignments as images and using a class of deep learning methods called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to make population genetic inferences from these images. We apply CNNs to a number of evolutionary questions and find that they frequently match or exceed the accuracy of current methods. Importantly, we show that CNNs perform accurate evolutionary model selection and parameter estimation, even on problems that have not received detailed theoretical treatments. Thus, when applied to population genetic alignments, CNNs are capable of outperforming expert-derived statistical methods and offer a new path forward in cases where no likelihood approach exists.},

  abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

It requires the combined analysis of the available information on protein sequence, phylogeny, gene-context and co-occurrence but is also aided by high-throughput experimental data.

Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

The expression of certain genes that directly control the rate of key metabolic pathways including glycolysis, lipogenesis and nucleotide synthesis are drastically altered at different stages of tumor progression. These alterations are generally considered as an adaptation of tumor cells; however, they also contribute to the progression of tumor cells to become more aggressive phenotypes. This review summarizes the recent information about the mechanistic link of these genes to oncogenesis and their potential utility as diagnostic markers as well as for therapeutic targets. We particularly focus on three groups of genes; GLUT1, G6PD, TKTL1 and PGI/AMF in glycolytic pathway, ACLY, ACC1 and FAS in lipogenesis and RRM2, p53R2 and TYMS for nucleotide synthesis. All these genes are highly up-regulated in a variety of tumor cells in cancer patients, and they play active roles in tumor progression rather than expressing merely as a consequence of phenotypic change of the cancer cells. Molecular dissection of their orchestrated networks and understanding the exact mechanism of their expression will provide a window of opportunity to target these genes for specific cancer therapy. We also reviewed existing database of gene microarray to validate the utility of these genes for cancer diagnosis.},

Such intratumoral heterogeneity poses a major challenge to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements of single-cell techniques such as scRNA-seq have brought unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity. Subsequently, a challenging computational problem is to cluster high dimensional noisy datasets with substantially fewer cells than the number of genes. METHODS: In this paper, we introduced a consensus clustering framework conCluster, for cancer subtype identification from single-cell RNA-seq data. Using an ensemble strategy, conCluster fuses multiple basic partitions to consensus clusters. RESULTS: Applied to real cancer scRNA-seq datasets, conCluster can more accurately detect cancer subtypes than the widely used scRNA-seq clustering methods. Further, we conducted co-expression network analysis for the identified melanoma subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that these subtypes exhibit distinct gene co-expression networks and significant gene sets with different functional enrichment.},

It is to learn the lowdimensional representation for nodes in a network, which benefits downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Most of the existing approaches learn node representations only based on the topological structure, yet nodes are often associated with rich attributes in many real-world applications. Thus, it is important and necessary to learn node representations based on both the topological structure and node attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel deep attributed network embedding approach, which can capture the high nonlinearity and preserve various proximities in both topological structure and node attributes. At the same time, a novel strategy is proposed to guarantee the learned node representation can encode the consistent and complementary information from the topological structure and node attributes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Different repositories of molecular interactions and available literature enable construction of focused and high-quality molecular interaction networks. Novel tools for curation and exploration of such networks are needed, in order to foster the development of a systems biology environment. In particular, solutions for visualization, annotation and data cross-linking will facilitate usage of network-encoded knowledge in biomedical research. To this end we developed the MINERVA (Molecular Interaction NEtwoRks VisuAlization) platform, a standalone webservice supporting curation, annotation and visualization of molecular interaction networks in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)-compliant format. MINERVA provides automated content annotation and verification for improved quality control. The end users can explore and interact with hosted networks, and provide direct feedback to content curators. MINERVA enables mapping drug targets or overlaying experimental data on the visualized networks. Extensive export functions enable downloading areas of the visualized networks as SBGN-compliant models for efficient reuse of hosted networks. The software is available under Affero GPL 3.0 as a Virtual Machine snapshot, Debian package and Docker instance at http://r3lab.uni.lu/web/minerva-website/. We believe that MINERVA is an important contribution to systems biology community, as its architecture enables set-up of locally or globally accessible SBGN-oriented repositories of molecular interaction networks. Its functionalities allow overlay of multiple information layers, facilitating exploration of content and interpretation of data. Moreover, annotation and verification workflows of MINERVA improve the efficiency of curation of networks, allowing life-science researchers to better engage in development and use of biomedical knowledge repositories.},

  abstract = {The last half-decade has seen a surge in deep learning research on irregular domains and efforts to extend convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to work on irregularly structured data. The graph has emerged as a particularly useful geometrical object in deep learning, able to represent a variety of irregular domains well. Graphs can represent various complex systems, from molecular structure, to computer and social and traffic networks. Consequent on the extension of CNNs to graphs, a great amount of research has been published that improves the inferential power and computational efficiency of graph-based convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). The research is incipient, however, and our understanding is relatively rudimentary. The majority of GCNNs are designed to operate with certain properties. In this survey we review of the state of graph representation learning from the perspective of deep learning. We consider challenges in graph deep learning that have been neglected in the majority of work, largely because of the numerous theoretical difficulties they present. We identify four major challenges in graph deep learning: dynamic and evolving graphs, learning with edge signals and information, graph estimation, and the generalization of graph models. For each problem we discuss the theoretical and practical issues, survey the relevant research, while highlighting the limitations of the state of the art. Advances on these challenges would permit GCNNs to be applied to wider range of domains, in situations where graph models have previously been limited owing to the obstructions to applying a model owing to the domains’ natures.},

Virtual screening is becoming increasingly popular in the field of drug discovery as in silico techniques are continuously being developed, improved, and made available. As most of these techniques are easy to use, both private and public organizations apply virtual screening methodologies to save resources in the laboratory. However, it is often the case that the techniques implemented in virtual screening workflows are restricted to those that the research team knows. Moreover, although the software is often easy to use, each methodology has a series of drawbacks that should be avoided so that false results or artifacts are not produced. Here, we review the most common methodologies used in virtual screening workflows in order to both introduce the inexperienced researcher to new methodologies and advise the experienced researcher on how to prevent common mistakes and the improper usage of virtual screening methodologies.},

Although many studies have investigated this issue, the link between body weight and either risk or poor outcome of breast cancer is still to characterize. Systems biology approaches, based on the integration of multiscale models and data from a wide variety of sources, are particularly suitable for investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms of complex diseases. In this scenario, GEnome-scale metabolic Models (GEMs) are a valuable tool, since they represent the metabolic structure of cells and provide a functional scaffold for simulating and quantifying metabolic fluxes in living organisms through constraint-based mathematical methods. The integration of omics data into the structural information described by GEMs allows to build more accurate descriptions of metabolic states.},

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules4,5 in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a ‘cartographic representation’ of complex networks. Metabolic networks6,7,8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

In GPLP, 1-hop subgraphs extracted from known network interaction matrix is learnt to predict missing links. To evaluate our method, three heterogeneous biomedical networks were used, i.e. Drug-Target Interaction network (DTI), Compound-Protein Interaction network (CPI) from NIH Tox21, and Compound-Virus Inhibition network (CVI). In 5-fold cross validation, our proposed GPLP method significantly outperforms over the state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, robustness is tested with different network incompleteness.

However, for several applications, smaller metabolic (core) models are needed. Using a recently introduced reduction algorithm and the latest E. coli genome-scale reconstruction iJO1366, we derived EColiCore2, a model of the central metabolism of E. coli. EColiCore2 is a subnetwork of iJO1366 and preserves predefined phenotypes including optimal growth on different substrates. The network comprises 486 metabolites and 499 reactions, is accessible for elementary-modes analysis and can, if required, be further compressed to a network with 82 reactions and 54 metabolites having an identical solution space as EColiCore2. A systematic comparison of EColiCore2 with its genome-scale parent model iJO1366 reveals that several key properties (flux ranges, reaction essentialities, production envelopes) of the central metabolism are preserved in EColiCore2 while it neglects redundancies along biosynthetic routes. We also compare calculated metabolic engineering strategies in both models and demonstrate, as a general result, how intervention strategies found in a core model allow the identification of valid strategies in a genome-scale model. Overall, EColiCore2 holds promise to become a reference model of E. coli’s central metabolism.},

In this paper we present a novel method to generate kinetic models of such cultures, rendering complex metabolic networks in a poly-pathway kinetic model. The model is based on subsets of elementary flux modes (EFMs) to generate macro-reactions. Thanks to our column generation-based optimization algorithm, the experimental data are used to identify the EFMs, which are relevant to the data. Here the systematic enumeration of all the EFMs is eliminated and a network including a large number of reactions can be considered. In particular, the poly-pathway model can simulate multiple metabolic behaviors in response to changes in the culture conditions. We apply the method to a network of 126 metabolic reactions describing cultures of antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary cells, and generate a poly-pathway model that simulates multiple experimental conditions obtained in response to variations in amino acid availability. A good fit between simulated and experimental data is obtained, rendering the variations in the growth, product, and metabolite uptake/secretion rates. The intracellular reaction fluxes simulated by the model are explored, linking variations in metabolic behavior to adaptations of the intracellular metabolism.},

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node’s local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

  abstract = {Background A central idea in biology is the hierarchical organization of cellular processes. A commonly used method to identify the hierarchical modular organization of network relies on detecting a global signature known as variation of clustering coefficient (so-called modularity scaling). Although several studies have suggested other possible origins of this signature, it is still widely used nowadays to identify hierarchical modularity, especially in the analysis of biological networks. Therefore, a further and systematical investigation of this signature for different types of biological networks is necessary. Results We analyzed a variety of biological networks and found that the commonly used signature of hierarchical modularity is actually the reflection of spoke-like topology, suggesting a different view of network architecture. We proved that the existence of super-hubs is the origin that the clustering coefficient of a node follows a particular scaling law with degree k in metabolic networks. To study the modularity of biological networks, we systematically investigated the relationship between repulsion of hubs and variation of clustering coefficient. We provided direct evidences for repulsion between hubs being the underlying origin of the variation of clustering coefficient, and found that for biological networks having no anti-correlation between hubs, such as gene co-expression network, the clustering coefficient doesn’t show dependence of degree. Conclusions Here we have shown that the variation of clustering coefficient is neither sufficient nor exclusive for a network to be hierarchical. Our results suggest the existence of spoke-like modules as opposed to “deterministic model” of hierarchical modularity, and suggest the need to reconsider the organizational principle of biological hierarchy.},

  abstract = {An important step in the reconstruction of a metabolic network is annotation of metabolites. Metabolites are generally annotated with various database or structure based identifiers. Metabolite annotations in metabolic reconstructions may be incorrect or incomplete and thus need to be updated prior to their use. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions generally include hundreds of metabolites. Manually updating annotations is therefore highly laborious. This prompted us to look for open-source software applications that could facilitate automatic updating of annotations by mapping between available metabolite identifiers. We identified three applications developed for the metabolomics and chemical informatics communities as potential solutions. The applications were MetMask, the Chemical Translation System, and UniChem. The first implements a “metabolite masking” strategy for mapping between identifiers whereas the latter two implement different versions of an InChI based strategy. Here we evaluated the suitability of these applications for the task of mapping between metabolite identifiers in genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. We applied the best suited application to updating identifiers in Recon 2, the latest reconstruction of human metabolism.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {Community detection, aiming at partitioning a network into multiple substructures, is practically importance. Graph convolutional network (GCN), a new deep-learning technique, has recently been developed for community detection. Markov Random Fields (MRF) has been combined with GCN in the MRFasGCN method to improve accuracy. However, the existing GCN community-finding methods are semi-supervised, even though community finding is essentially an unsupervised learning problem. We developed a new GCN approach for unsupervised community detection under the framework of Autoencoder. We cast MRFasGCN as an encoder and then derived node community membership in the hidden layer of the encoder. We introduced a community-centric dual decoder to reconstruct network structures and node attributes separately in an unsupervised fashion, for faithful community detection in the input space. We designed a scheme of local enhancement to accommodate nodes to have more common neighbors and similar attributes with similar community memberships. Experimental results on real networks showed that our new method outperformed the best existing methods, showing the effectiveness of the novel decoding mechanism for generating links and attributes together over the commonly used methods for reconstructing links alone.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

As a solution we propose duplicating actors in social networks and discuss potential impact of such a move. Several visual duplication designs are discussed and a controlled experiment comparing network visualization with and without duplication is performed, using 6 tasks that are important for graph readability and visual interpretation of social networks. We show that in our experiment, duplications significantly improve community-related tasks but sometimes interfere with other graph readability tasks.

The integration and interpretation of such data pose major challenges, calling for adequate knowledge models. Disease maps provide curated knowledge about disorders' pathophysiology at the molecular level adapted to omics measurements. However, the expressiveness of disease maps could be increased to help in avoiding ambiguities and misinterpretations and to reinforce their interoperability with other knowledge resources. Ontology is an adequate framework to overcome this limitation, through their axiomatic definitions and logical reasoning properties. We introduce the Disease Map Ontology (DMO), an ontological upper model based on systems biology terms. We then propose to apply DMO to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we use it to drive the conversion of AlzPathway, a disease map devoted to AD, into a formal ontology: Alzheimer DMO. We demonstrate that it allows one to deal with issues related to redundancy, naming, consistency, process classification and pathway relationships. Furthermore, we show that it can store and manage multi-omics data. Finally, we expand the model using elements from other resources, such as clinical features contained in the AD Ontology, resulting in an enriched model called ADMO-plus.

In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Structural Attention Neural Network (HetSANN) to directly encode structural information of HIN without meta-path and achieve more informative representations. With this method, domain experts will not be needed to design meta-path schemes and the heterogeneous information can be processed automatically by our proposed model. Specifically, we implicitly represent heterogeneous information using the following two methods: 1) we model the transformation between heterogeneous vertices through a projection in low-dimensional entity spaces; 2) afterwards, we apply the graph neural network to aggregate multi-relational information of projected neighborhood by means of attention mechanism. We also present three extensions of HetSANN, i.e., voices-sharing product attention for the pairwise relationships in HIN, cycle-consistency loss to retain the transformation between heterogeneous entity spaces, and multi-task learning with full use of information. The experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed models achieve significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

Therefore, this study uses RNA-sequencing data from TCGA and focuses on classifying thirty-three types of cancer patients. Five ML algorithms include decision tree (DT), k nearest neighbor (kNN), linear support vector machine (linear SVM), polynomial support vector machine (poly SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) are conducted to compare the performances of their accuracies, training time, precisions, recalls, and F1-scores.

Such networks are on one hand commonly regarded as modular (i.e. built by a number of relatively independent subsystems), but on the other hand they are robust in a way not expected of a purely modular system. To address this question we carefully discuss the partition of metabolic networks into subnetworks. The practice of preprocessing such networks by removing the most abundant substrates, "currency metabolites," is formalized into a network-based algorithm. We study partitions for metabolic networks of many organisms and find cores of currency metabolites and modular peripheries of what we call "commodity metabolites." The networks are found to be more modular than random networks but far from perfectly divisible into modules. We argue that cross-modular edges are the key for the robustness of metabolism.},

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Like the Word2vec models, where vectors of closely related words are in close proximity in the vector space, Mol2vec learns vector representations of molecular substructures that point in similar directions for chemically related substructures. Compounds can finally be encoded as vectors by summing the vectors of the individual substructures and, for instance, be fed into supervised machine learning approaches to predict compound properties. The underlying substructure vector embeddings are obtained by training an unsupervised machine learning approach on a so-called corpus of compounds that consists of all available chemical matter. The resulting Mol2vec model is pretrained once, yields dense vector representations, and overcomes drawbacks of common compound feature representations such as sparseness and bit collisions. The prediction capabilities are demonstrated on several compound property and bioactivity data sets and compared with results obtained for Morgan fingerprints as a reference compound representation. Mol2vec can be easily combined with ProtVec, which employs the same Word2vec concept on protein sequences, resulting in a proteochemometric approach that is alignment-independent and thus can also be easily used for proteins with low sequence similarities.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous information networks (HINs), also called heterogeneous graphs, are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, and contain comprehensive information and rich semantics. Graph neural networks (GNNs), as powerful tools for graph data, have shown superior performance on network analysis. Recently, many excellent models have been proposed to process hetero-graph data using GNNs and have achieved great success. These GNN-based heterogeneous models can be interpreted as smooth node attributes guided by graph structure, which requires all nodes to have attributes. However, this is not easy to satisfy, as some types of nodes often have no attributes in heterogeneous graphs. Previous studies take some handcrafted methods to solve this problem, which separate the attribute completion from the graph learning process and, in turn, result in poor performance. In this paper, we hold that missing attributes can be acquired by a learnable manner, and propose a general framework for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network via Attribute Completion (HGNN-AC), including pre-learning of topological embedding and attribute completion with attention mechanism. HGNN-AC first uses existing HIN-Embedding methods to obtain node topological embedding. Then it uses the topological relationship between nodes as guidance to complete attributes for no-attribute nodes by weighted aggregation of the attributes from these attributed nodes. Our complement mechanism can be easily combined with an arbitrary GNN-based heterogeneous model making the whole system end-to-end. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graphs. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over stateof-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {Drug metabolism is determined by the biochemical and physiological properties of the drug molecule. To improve the performance of a drug property prediction model, it is important to extract complex molecular dynamics from limited data. Recent machine learning or deep learning based models have employed the atom- and bond-type information, as well as the structural information to predict drug properties. However, many of these methods can be used only for the graph representations. Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) (Gilmer et al., 2017) is a framework used to learn both local and global features from irregularly formed data, and is invariant to permutations. This network performs an iterative message passing (MP) operation on each object and its neighbors, and obtain the final output from all messages regardless of their order. In this study, we applied the MP-based attention network (Nikolentzos et al., 2019) originally developed for text learning to perform chemical classification tasks. Before training, we tokenized the characters, and obtained embeddings of each molecular sequence. We conducted various experiments to maximize the predictivity of the model. We trained and evaluated our model using various chemical classification benchmark tasks. Our results are comparable to previous state-of-the-art and baseline models or outperform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to learn chemical strings using an MP-based algorithm. We will extend our work to more complex tasks such as regression or generation tasks in the future.},

In order to define it properly, we generalize the Chung-Lu model for graphs to hypergraphs. We then provide the theoretical foundations to search for an optimal solution with respect to our hypergraph modularity function. A simple heuristic algorithm is described and applied to a few illustrative examples. We show that using a strict version of our proposed modularity function often leads to a solution where a smaller number of hyperedges get cut as compared to optimizing modularity of 2-section graph of a hypergraph.},

In contrast to the spatially local convolutions done in traditional image-based CNNs, our BrainNetCNN is composed of novel edge-to-edge, edge-to-node and node-to-graph convolutional filters that leverage the topological locality of structural brain networks. We apply the BrainNetCNN framework to predict cognitive and motor developmental outcome scores from structural brain networks of infants born preterm. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) of preterm infants, acquired between 27 and 46 weeks gestational age, were used to construct a dataset of structural brain connectivity networks. We first demonstrate the predictive capabilities of BrainNetCNN on synthetic phantom networks with simulated injury patterns and added noise. BrainNetCNN outperforms a fully connected neural-network with the same number of model parameters on both phantoms with focal and diffuse injury patterns. We then apply our method to the task of joint prediction of Bayley-III cognitive and motor scores, assessed at 18 months of age, adjusted for prematurity. We show that our BrainNetCNN framework outperforms a variety of other methods on the same data. Furthermore, BrainNetCNN is able to identify an infant's postmenstrual age to within about 2 weeks. Finally, we explore the high-level features learned by BrainNetCNN by visualizing the importance of each connection in the brain with respect to predicting the outcome scores. These findings are then discussed in the context of the anatomy and function of the developing preterm infant brain.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a method of classifying cancers to specific diagnostic categories based on their gene expression signatures using artificial neural networks (ANNs). We trained the ANNs using the small, round blue-cell tumors (SRBCTs) as a model. These cancers belong to four distinct diagnostic categories and often present diagnostic dilemmas in clinical practice. The ANNs correctly classified all samples and identified the genes most relevant to the classification. Expression of several of these genes has been reported in SRBCTs, but most have not been associated with these cancers. To test the ability of the trained ANN models to recognize SRBCTs, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure, and correctly classified them in all cases. This study demonstrates the potential applications of these methods for tumor diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy.},

  abstract = {Over the last 50 years a wide variety of automatic network layout algorithms have been developed. Some are fast heuristic techniques suitable for networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes while others are multi-stage frameworks for higher-quality layout of smaller networks. However, despite decades of research currently no algorithm produces layout of comparable quality to that of a human. We give a new “human-centred” methodology for automatic network layout algorithm design that is intended to overcome this deficiency. User studies are first used to identify the aesthetic criteria algorithms should encode, then an algorithm is developed that is informed by these criteria and finally, a follow-up study evaluates the algorithm output. We have used this new methodology to develop an automatic orthogonal network layout method, HOLA, that achieves measurably better (by user study) layout than the best available orthogonal layout algorithm and which produces layouts of comparable quality to those produced by hand.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic network model (GEM) is a fundamental framework in systems metabolic engineering. GEM is built upon extensive experimental data and literature information on gene annotation and function, metabolites and enzymes so that it contains all known metabolic reactions within an organism. Constraint-based analysis of GEM enables the identification of phenotypic properties of an organism and hypothesis-driven engineering of cellular functions to achieve objectives. Along with the advances in omics, high-throughput technology and computational algorithms, the scope and applications of GEM have substantially expanded. In particular, various computational algorithms have been developed to predict beneficial gene deletion and amplification targets and used to guide the strain development process for the efficient production of industrially important chemicals. Furthermore, an Escherichia coli GEM was integrated with a pathway prediction algorithm and used to evaluate all possible routes for the production of a list of commodity chemicals in E. coli. Combined with the wealth of experimental data produced by high-throughput techniques, much effort has been exerted to add more biological contexts into GEM through the integration of omics data and regulatory network information for the mechanistic understanding and improved prediction capabilities. In this paper, we review the recent developments and applications of GEM focusing on the GEM-based computational algorithms available for microbial metabolic engineering.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detection of central nodes in asymmetrically directed biological networks depends on centrality metrics quantifying individual nodes' importance in a network. In topological analyses on metabolic networks, various centrality metrics have been mostly applied to metabolite-centric graphs. However, centrality metrics including those not depending on high connections are largely unexplored for directed reaction-centric graphs. RESULTS: We applied directed versions of centrality metrics to directed reaction-centric graphs of microbial metabolic networks. To investigate the local role of a node, we developed a novel metric, cascade number, considering how many nodes are closed off from information flow when a particular node is removed. High modularity and scale-freeness were found in the directed reaction-centric graphs and betweenness centrality tended to belong to densely connected modules. Cascade number and bridging centrality identified cascade subnetworks controlling local information flow and irreplaceable bridging nodes between functional modules, respectively. Reactions highly ranked with bridging centrality and cascade number tended to be essential, compared to reactions that other central metrics detected. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that cascade number and bridging centrality are useful to identify key reactions controlling local information flow in directed reaction-centric graphs of microbial metabolic networks. Knowledge about the local flow connectivity and connections between local modules will contribute to understand how metabolic pathways are assembled.},

  abstract = {Systems biology has greatly contributed toward the analysis and understanding of biological systems under various genotypic and environmental conditions on a much larger scale than ever before. One of the applications of systems biology can be seen in unraveling and understanding complicated human diseases where the primary causes for a disease are often not clear. The in silico genome-scale metabolic network models can be employed for the analysis of diseases and for the discovery of novel drug targets suitable for treating the disease. Also, new antimicrobial targets can be discovered by analyzing, at the systems level, the genome-scale metabolic network of pathogenic microorganisms. Such applications are possible as these genome-scale metabolic network models contain extensive stoichiometric relationships among the metabolites constituting the organism's metabolism and information on the associated biophysical constraints. In this review, we highlight applications of genome-scale metabolic network modeling and simulations in predicting drug targets and designing potential strategies in combating pathogenic infection. Also, the use of metabolic network models in the systematic analysis of several human diseases is examined. Other computational and experimental approaches are discussed to complement the use of metabolic network models in the analysis of biological systems and to facilitate the drug discovery pipeline.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Given a list of genes, a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis may return hundreds of statistically significant GO results in a “flat” list, which can be challenging to summarize. It can also be difficult to keep pace with rapidly expanding biological knowledge, which often results in daily changes to any of the over 47,000 gene ontologies that describe biological knowledge. GOATOOLS, a Python-based library, makes it more efficient to stay current with the latest ontologies and annotations, perform gene ontology enrichment analyses to determine over- and under-represented terms, and organize results for greater clarity and easier interpretation using a novel GOATOOLS GO grouping method. We performed functional analyses on both stochastic simulation data and real data from a published RNA-seq study to compare the enrichment results from GOATOOLS to two other popular tools: DAVID and GOstats.

  abstract = {In this paper we outline an approach to detect concepts and relations among concepts from heterogeneous domains in order to support the creative thinking. This is achieved by integrating units of information and their relations from heterogeneous data sources into a unifying model, represented through a network and analyzing the resulting network structure. We discuss the extraction of semantical meaningful concepts and aspects, that describe the concepts, based on the relations of the integrated units of information. This semantical information can be used to create a high level view of the resulting network and the discovery of domain crossing concepts ultimately triggers new insights.},

  abstract = {Given information about medical drugs and their properties, how can we automatically discover that Aspirin has blood-thinning properties, and thus prevents heart attacks? Expressed in more general terms, if we have a large information network that integrates data from heterogeneous data sources, how can we extract semantic information that provides a better understanding of the integrated data and also helps us to identify missing links? We propose to extract concepts that describe groups of objects and their common properties from the integrated data. The discovered concepts provide semantic information as well as an abstract view on the integrated data and thus improve the understanding of complex systems. Our proposed method has the following desirable properties: (a) it is parameter-free and therefore requires no user-defined parameters (b) it is fault-tolerant, allowing for the detection of missing links and (c) it is scalable, being linear on the input size.We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method on real, publicly available graphs},

  abstract = {Graph kernels have become an established and widely-used technique for solving classification tasks on graphs. This survey gives a comprehensive overview of techniques for kernel-based graph classification developed in the past 15 years. We describe and categorize graph kernels based on properties inherent to their design, such as the nature of their extracted graph features, their method of computation and their applicability to problems in practice. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we study the classification accuracy of a large suite of graph kernels on established benchmarks as well as new datasets. We compare the performance of popular kernels with several baseline methods and study the effect of applying a Gaussian RBF kernel to the metric induced by a graph kernel. In doing so, we find that simple baselines become competitive after this transformation on some datasets. Moreover, we study the extent to which existing graph kernels agree in their predictions (and prediction errors) and obtain a data-driven categorization of kernels as result. Finally, based on our experimental results, we derive a practitioner’s guide to kernel-based graph classification.},

In this work, we generalize the framework of modularity maximization for clustering on hypergraphs. To this end, we introduce a hypergraph null model, analogous to the configuration model on undirected graphs, and a node-degree preserving reduction to work with this model. This is used to define a modularity function that can be maximized using the popular and fast Louvain algorithm. We additionally propose a refinement over this clustering, by reweighting cut hyperedges in an iterative fashion. The efficacy and efficiency of our methods are demonstrated on several real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Cancerogenesis is driven by mutations leading to aberrant functioning of a complex network of molecular interactions and simultaneously affecting multiple cellular functions. Therefore, the successful application of bioinformatics and systems biology methods for analysis of high-throughput data in cancer research heavily depends on availability of global and detailed reconstructions of signalling networks amenable for computational analysis. We present here the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), an interactive and comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms implicated in cancer. The resource includes tools for map navigation, visualization and analysis of molecular data in the context of signalling network maps. Constructing and updating ACSN involves careful manual curation of molecular biology literature and participation of experts in the corresponding fields. The cancer-oriented content of ACSN is completely original and covers major mechanisms involved in cancer progression, including DNA repair, cell survival, apoptosis, cell cycle, EMT and cell motility. Cell signalling mechanisms are depicted in detail, together creating a seamless ‘geographic-like’ map of molecular interactions frequently deregulated in cancer. The map is browsable using NaviCell web interface using the Google Maps engine and semantic zooming principle. The associated web-blog provides a forum for commenting and curating the ACSN content. ACSN allows uploading heterogeneous omics data from users on top of the maps for visualization and performing functional analyses. We suggest several scenarios for ACSN application in cancer research, particularly for visualizing high-throughput data, starting from small interfering RNA-based screening results or mutation frequencies to innovative ways of exploring transcriptomes and phosphoproteomes. Integration and analysis of these data in the context of ACSN may help interpret their biological significance and formulate mechanistic hypotheses. ACSN may also support patient stratification, prediction of treatment response and resistance to cancer drugs, as well as design of novel treatment strategies.},

Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom, Blondel et al. and Ronhovde and Nussinov, respectively, have an excellent performance, with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large systems.},

Metabolomics is independently advancing as a set of high-throughput data acquisition tools providing dynamic profiles of metabolites in an unbiased manner. These data sets are neither yet sufficiently comprehensive nor accurate enough for generating large-scale kinetic models. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop quantitative techniques that can make use of the emerging data and embrace the associated uncertainties. This article reviews recent advances in FBA to meet this need and discusses the utility of FBA as a complement to metabolomics and the expected synergy as a result of combining these two techniques.},

The growing interest in graph-structured data increases the importance of gaining human insight into such datasets by means of visualization. However, among the most popular visualization techniques, classical t-SNE is not suitable on such datasets because it has no mechanism to make use of information from graph connectivity. On the other hand, standard graph visualization techniques, such as Laplacian Eigenmaps, have no mechanism to make use of information from node features. Our proposed method GraphTSNE is able to produce visualizations which account for both graph connectivity and node features. It is based on scalable and unsupervised training of a graph convolutional network on a modified t-SNE loss. By assembling a suite of evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our method produces desirable visualizations on three benchmark datasets.},

We introduce maximum disjoint simple sharing problem, which is naturally a 2-approximation of the maximum simple sharing problem, and show it can be solve optimally by reducing to the perfect matching problem in a series carefully constructed graph. At last, we further improve the approximation factor to 12/7 through a local search technique.},

We synthesize a spectrum of algorithmic approaches that, at their core, leverage topological features to embed networks into compact vector spaces. We also provide a taxonomy of biomedical areas that are likely to benefit most from algorithmic innovation.

  abstract = {Knowing protein function is crucial to advance molecular and medical biology, yet experimental function annotations through the Gene Ontology (GO) exist for fewer than 0.5\% of all known proteins. Computational methods bridge this sequence-annotation gap typically through homology-based annotation transfer by identifying sequence-similar proteins with known function or through prediction methods using evolutionary information. Here, we propose predicting GO terms through annotation transfer based on proximity of proteins in the SeqVec embedding rather than in sequence space. These embeddings originate from deep learned language models (LMs) for protein sequences (SeqVec) transferring the knowledge gained from predicting the next amino acid in 33 million protein sequences. Replicating the conditions of CAFA3, our method reaches an Fmax of 37\,±\,2\%, 50\,±\,3\%, and 57\,±\,2\% for BPO, MFO, and CCO, respectively. Numerically, this appears close to the top ten CAFA3 methods. When restricting the annotation transfer to proteins with\,{$<$}\,20\% pairwise sequence identity to the query, performance drops (Fmax BPO 33\,±\,2\%, MFO 43\,±\,3\%, CCO 53\,±\,2\%); this still outperforms naïve sequence-based transfer. Preliminary results from CAFA4 appear to confirm these findings. Overall, this new concept is likely to change the annotation of proteins, in particular for proteins from smaller families or proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.},

Normally, the Softmax activation function is used as classifier in the last layer of CNN. However, there some studies try to replace the Softmax layer with the support vector machine (SVM) in an artificial neural network architecture and achieve great results. Inspired by these works, we research the performance of CNN with linear SVM classifier on the gender recognition based on CASIA-B dataset. In the first model, the input image's descriptors are extracted from the fully connected layer of the pre-trained VGGNet-16 model as the features to train the SVM. In the second model, we adjust VGGNet-16 with a hinge loss function using an L2 norm to create a new architecture, namely VGGNet-SVM. The results have shown that SVM shows the better performance than Softmax in VGGNet-16 to work out the gender recognition problem based on gait.},

However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL), which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning paradigm for graph data. Different from other domains like computer vision/natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph selfsupervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data.

However, these methods are time consuming and lack universality, and it is difficult to exploit the auxiliary information of nodes and edges.

This thus facilitates the application of machine learning algorithms for subsequent processing.

However, there is no systematic review of this issue. This article offers a comprehensive survey of the primary network embedding methods and their applications in drug analysis and prediction. The network embedding technologies applied in homogeneous network and heterogeneous network are investigated and compared, including matrix decomposition, random walk, and deep learning. Especially, the Graph neural network (GNN) methods in deep learning are highlighted.

However, most previous cancer classification studies are clinical based and have limited diagnostic ability. Cancer classification using gene expression data is known to contain the keys for addressing the fundamental problems relating to cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. The recent advent of DNA microarray technique has made simultaneous monitoring of thousands of gene expressions possible. With this abundance of gene expression data, researchers have started to explore the possibilities of cancer classification using gene expression data. Quite a number of methods have been proposed in recent years with promising results. But there are still a lot of issues which need to be addressed and understood. In order to gain a deep insight into the cancer classification problem, it is necessary to take a closer look at the problem, the proposed solutions and the related issues all together. In this survey paper, we present a comprehensive overview of various proposed cancer classification methods and evaluate them based on their computation time, classification accuracy and ability to reveal biologically meaningful gene information. We also introduce and evaluate various proposed gene selection methods which we believe should be an integral preprocessing step for cancer classification. In order to obtain a full picture of cancer classification, we also discuss several issues related to cancer classification, including the biological significance vs. statistical significance of a cancer classifier, the asymmetrical classification errors for cancer classifiers, and the gene contamination problem.},

  abstract = {The network embedding problem that maps nodes in a graph to vectors in Euclidean space can be very useful for addressing several important tasks on a graph. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed for solving such a problem. However, most embedding algorithms and GNNs are difficult to interpret and do not scale well to handle millions of nodes. In this paper, we tackle the problem from a new perspective based on the equivalence of three constrained optimization problems: the network embedding problem, the trace maximization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph, and the matrix factorization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph. The optimal solutions to these three problems are the dominant eigenvectors of the modularity matrix. We proposed two algorithms that belong to a special class of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for solving these problems: (i) Clustering As Feature Embedding GCN (CAFE-GCN) and (ii) sphere-GCN. Both algorithms are stable trace maximization algorithms, and they yield good approximations of dominant eigenvectors. Moreover, there are linear-time implementations for sparse graphs. In addition to solving the network embedding problem, both proposed GCNs are capable of performing dimensionality reduction. Various experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed GCNs and show that our proposed GCNs outperform almost all the baseline methods. Moreover, CAFE-GCN could be benefited from the labeled data and have tremendous improvements in various performance metrics.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Metabolic networks are organized in a modular, hierarchical manner. Methods for a rational decomposition of the metabolic network into relatively independent functional subsets are essential to better understand the modularity and organization principle of a large-scale, genome-wide network. Network decomposition is also necessary for functional analysis of metabolism by pathway analysis methods that are often hampered by the problem of combinatorial explosion due to the complexity of metabolic network. Decomposition methods proposed in literature are mainly based on the connection degree of metabolites. To obtain a more reasonable decomposition, the global connectivity structure of metabolic networks should be taken into account.Results: In this work, we use a reaction graph representation of a metabolic network for the identification of its global connectivity structure and for decomposition. A bow-tie connectivity structure similar to that previously discovered for metabolite graph is found also to exist in the reaction graph. Based on this bow-tie structure, a new decomposition method is proposed, which uses a distance definition derived from the path length between two reactions. An hierarchical classification tree is first constructed from the distance matrix among the reactions in the giant strong component of the bow-tie structure. These reactions are then grouped into different subsets based on the hierarchical tree. Reactions in the IN and OUT subsets of the bow-tie structure are subsequently placed in the corresponding subsets according to a ‘majority rule’. Compared with the decomposition methods proposed in literature, ours is based on combined properties of the global network structure and local reaction connectivity rather than, primarily, on the connection degree of metabolites. The method is applied to decompose the metabolic network of Escherichia coli. Eleven subsets are obtained. More detailed investigations of the subsets show that reactions in the same subset are really functionally related. The rational decomposition of metabolic networks, and subsequent studies of the subsets, make it more amenable to understand the inherent organization and functionality of metabolic networks at the modular level.Supplementary Information:http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/},

Furthermore, the distribution of the disease related genes in the network suggests that the IN (substrates) subset of the bow-tie structure has more flexibility than other parts.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great prowess in learning representations suitable for numerous graph-based machine learning tasks. When applied to semi-supervised node classification, GNNs are widely believed to work well due to the homophily assumption (``like attracts like''), and fail to generalize to heterophilous graphs where dissimilar nodes connect. Recent works design new architectures to overcome such heterophily-related limitations, citing poor baseline performance and new architecture improvements on a few heterophilous graph benchmark datasets as evidence for this notion. In our experiments, we empirically find that standard graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can actually achieve better performance than such carefully designed methods on some commonly used heterophilous graphs. This motivates us to reconsider whether homophily is truly necessary for good GNN performance. We find that this claim is not quite true, and in fact, GCNs can achieve strong performance on heterophilous graphs under certain conditions. Our work carefully characterizes these conditions, and provides supporting theoretical understanding and empirical observations. Finally, we examine existing heterophilous graphs benchmarks and reconcile how the GCN (under)performs on them based on this understanding.},

  abstract = {Function-related metabolites, the terminal products of the cell regulation, show a close association with complex diseases. The identification of disease-related metabolites is critical to the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases. However, most existing computational approaches build networks by calculating pairwise relationships, which is inappropriate for mining higher-order relationships.In this study, we presented a novel approach with hypergraph-based logistic matrix factorization, HGLMF, to predict the potential interactions between metabolites and disease. First, the molecular structures and gene associations of metabolites and the hierarchical structures and GO functional annotations of diseases were extracted to build various similarity measures of metabolites and diseases. Next, the kernel neighborhood similarity of metabolites (or diseases) was calculated according to the completed interactive network. Second, multiple networks of metabolites and diseases were fused, respectively, and the hypergraph structures of metabolites and diseases were built. Lastly, a logistic matrix factorization based on hypergraph was proposed to predict potential metabolite-disease interactions. In computational experiments, HGLMF accurately predicted the metabolite-disease interaction, and performed better than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HGLMF could be employed to predict new metabolites (or diseases). As suggested from the case studies, the proposed method could discover novel disease-related metabolites, which has been confirmed in existing studies.The codes and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Mayingjun20179/HGLMF.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

These networks are often very large and complex. To properly understand and analyze the global properties of metabolic networks, methods for rationally representing and quantitatively analyzing their structure are needed. RESULTS In this work, the metabolic networks of 80 fully sequenced organisms are in silico reconstructed from genome data and an extensively revised bioreaction database. The networks are represented as directed graphs and analyzed by using the \&\#39;breadth first searching algorithm to identify the shortest pathway (path length) between any pair of the metabolites. The average path length of the networks are then calculated and compared for all the organisms. Different from previous studies the connections through current metabolites and cofactors are deleted to make the path length analysis physiologically more meaningful. The distribution of the connection degree of these networks is shown to follow the power law, indicating that the overall structure of all the metabolic networks has the characteristics of a small world network. However, clear differences exist in the network structure of the three domains of organisms. Eukaryotes and archaea have a longer average path length than bacteria.

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have risen to prominence in learning representations for graph structured data. A single GNN layer typically consists of a feature transformation and a feature aggregation operation. The former normally uses feed-forward networks to transform features, while the latter aggregates the transformed features over the graph. Numerous recent works have proposed GNN models with different designs in the aggregation operation. In this work, we establish mathematically that the aggregation processes in a group of representative GNN models including GCN, GAT, PPNP, and APPNP can be regarded as (approximately) solving a graph denoising problem with a smoothness assumption. Such a unified view across GNNs not only provides a new perspective to understand a variety of aggregation operations but also enables us to develop a unified graph neural network framework UGNN. To demonstrate its promising potential, we instantiate a novel GNN model, ADA-UGNN, derived from UGNN, to handle graphs with adaptive smoothness across nodes. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of ADA-UGNN.},

Methods capable of providing a representation that looks beyond the single node neighborhood are kernel graphs. However, they produce handcrafted features unaccustomed with a generalized model. To reduce this gap, in this work we propose a neural embedding framework, based on probability distribution representations of graphs, named Netpro2vec. The goal is to look at basic node descriptions other than the degree, such as those induced by the Transition Matrix and Node Distance Distribution. Netpro2vec provides embeddings completely independent from the task and nature of the data.

For this reason, graph-based pattern recognition gained a lot of attention in recent years. In this paper, a general-purpose classification system in the graphs domain is presented. When most of the information of the available patterns can be encoded in edge labels, an information granulation-based approach is highly discriminant and allows for the identification of semantically meaningful edges. The proposed classification system has been tested on the entire set of organisms (5299) for which metabolic networks are known, allowing for both a perfect mirroring of the underlying taxonomy and the identification of most discriminant metabolic reactions and pathways. The widespread diffusion of graph (network) structures in biology makes the proposed pattern recognition approach potentially very useful in many different fields of application. More specifically, the possibility to have a reliable metric to compare different metabolic systems is instrumental in emerging fields like microbiome analysis and, more in general, for proposing metabolic networks as a universal phenotype spanning the entire tree of life and in direct contact with environmental cues.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks have emerged as a useful tool to learn on the data by applying additional constraints based on the graph structure. These graphs are often created with assumed intrinsic relations between the entities. In recent years, there have been tremendous improvements in the architecture design, pushing the performance up in various prediction tasks. In general, these neural architectures combine layer depth and node feature aggregation steps. This makes it challenging to analyze the importance of features at various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As different graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in features and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which features are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information. In this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph neural network and introduce several key design strategies for graph neural networks. More specifically, we propose to use softmax as a regularizer and "Soft-Selector" of features aggregated from neighbors at different hop distances; and "Hop-Normalization" over GNN layers. Combining these techniques, we present a simple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph Neural Network (FSGNN), and show empirically that the proposed model outperforms other state of the art GNN models and achieves up to 64\% improvements in accuracy on node classification tasks. Moreover, analyzing the learned soft-selection parameters of the model provides a simple way to study the importance of features in the prediction tasks. Finally, we demonstrate with experiments that the model is scalable for large graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges. Source code at https://github.com/sunilkmaurya/FSGNN},

In the vertex splitting problem, the objective is to determine a minimum number of vertices from the graph to split such that the resulting graph has no path of length greater than a given δ. The problem has been proven to be NP-hard. A Genetic Algorithm is used to solve the DAG Vertex Splitting Problem. This approach uses a variable string length to represent the vertices that split the graph and a dynamic population size.

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of senile dementia. Many inflammatory factors such as amyloid-β and pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to contribute to the inflammatory response in the AD brain. Sphingolipids are widely known to have roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, where the precise roles for sphingolipids in inflammation-associated pathogenesis of AD are not well understood. Here we performed a network analysis to clarify the importance of sphingolipids and to model relationships among inflammatory factors and sphingolipids in AD. In this study, we have updated sphingolipid signaling and metabolic cascades in a map of AD signaling networks that we named "AlzPathway," a comprehensive knowledge repository of signaling pathways in AD. Our network analysis of the updated AlzPathway indicates that the pathways related to ceramide are one of the primary pathways and that ceramide is one of the important players in the pathogenesis of AD. The results of our analysis suggest the following two prospects about inflammation in AD: (1) ceramide could play important roles in both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways of AD, and (2) several factors such as Sphingomyelinase and Siglec-11 may be associated with ceramide related inflammation and anti-inflammation pathways in AD. In this study, network analysis of comprehensive knowledge repository reveals a dual role for ceramide in AD. This result provides a clue to clarify sphingolipids related inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways in AD.},

Given the importance of interactions in biological processes, such as the interactions betweenproteins or the bonds within a chemical compound, this data is often represented in the form of a biological network. Therise of this data has created a need for new computational tools to analyze networks. One major trend in the field is to usedeep learning for this goal and, more specifically, to use methods that work with networks, the so-called graph neuralnetworks (GNNs). In this article, we describe biological networks and review the principles and underlying algorithms ofGNNs. We then discuss domains in bioinformatics in which graph neural networks are frequently being applied at themoment, such as protein function prediction, protein–protein interaction prediction andin silicodrug discovery anddevelopment. Finally, we highlight application areas such as gene regulatory networks and disease diagnosis where deeplearning is emerging as a new tool to answer classic questions like gene interaction prediction and automatic diseaseprediction from data.},

  abstract = {The prediction of interactions in protein networks is very critical in various biological processes. In recent years, scientists have focused on computational approaches to predict the interactions of proteins. In protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, each protein is accompanied by various features, including amino acid sequence, subcellular location, and protein domains. Embedding-based methods have been widely applied for many network analysis tasks, such as link prediction. The Deepwalk algorithm is one of the most popular graph embedding methods that capture the network structure using pure random walking. Here in this paper, we treat the protein-protein interaction prediction problem as a link prediction in attributed networks, and we use an attributed embedding approach to predict the interactions between proteins in the PPI network. In particular, the present paper seeks to present a modified version of Deepwalk based on feature selection for solving link prediction in the protein-protein interaction, which will benefit both network structure and protein features. More specifically the feature selection step consists of two distinct parts. First, a set of relevant features are selected from the original feature set, such that the dimensionality of features is reduced. Second, in the selected set of features, each feature is assigned with a weight based on its significance and therefore the contribution of each feature is distinguished from others. In this method, the new random walk model for link prediction will be introduced by integrating network structure and protein features, based on the assumption that two nodes on the network will be linked since they are nearby in the network. In order to justify the proposal, the authors carry out many experiments on protein-protein interaction networks for comparison with the state-of-the-art network embedding methods. The experimental results from the graphs indicate that our proposed approach is more capable compared to other link prediction approaches and increases the accuracy of prediction.},

Since biological networks are notoriously complex and hard to decipher, a growing body of work applies graph embedding techniques to simplify, visualize, and facilitate the analysis of the resulting networks. In this review, we survey traditional and new approaches for graph embedding and compare their application to fundamental problems in network biology with using the networks directly. We consider a broad variety of applications including protein network alignment, community detection, and protein function prediction. We find that in all of these domains both types of approaches are of value and their performance depends on the evaluation measures being used and the goal of the project. In particular, network embedding methods outshine direct methods according to some of those measures and are, thus, an essential tool in bioinformatics research.},

This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a centrality measure that identifies vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong.

Finally, the response value of each drug-cell line pair is predicted by a fully-connected neural network. Four variants of graph convolutional networks are used for learning the features of drugs. Results: We find that GraphDRP outperforms tCNN in all performance measures for all experiments. Also, through saliency maps of the resulting GraphDRP models, we discover the contribution of the genomic aberrations to the responses. Conclusion: Representing drugs as graphs are able to improve the performance of drug response prediction. Data and source code can be downloaded at https://github.com/hauldhut/GraphDRP.},

Results from such simulation experiments can be affected at least in part by the quality of the metabolic models used. Reconstructing a metabolic network manually can produce a high-quality metabolic model but is a time-consuming task. At the same time, current methods for automating the process typically transfer metabolic function based on sequence similarity, a process known to produce many false positives. Results We created Architect, a pipeline for automatic metabolic model reconstruction from protein sequences. First, it performs enzyme annotation through an ensemble approach, whereby a likelihood score is computed for an EC prediction based on predictions from existing tools; for this step, our method shows both increased precision and recall compared to individual tools. Next, Architect uses these annotations to construct a high-quality metabolic network which is then gap-filled based on likelihood scores from the ensemble approach. The resulting metabolic model is output in SBML format, suitable for constraints-based analyses. Through comparisons of enzyme annotations and curated metabolic models, we demonstrate improved performance of Architect over other state-of-the-art tools. Availability Code for Architect is available at https://github.com/ParkinsonLab/Architect.

In this chapter, we introduce the manual construction of a pathway map in AD which we call "AlzPathway", that comprehensively catalogs signaling pathways in the field of AD. We have collected and manually curated over 100 review articles related to AD, and have built the AD pathway map. AlzPathway is currently composed of thousands of molecules and reactions in neurons, brain blood barrier, presynaptic, postsynaptic, astrocyte, and microglial cells, with their cellular localizations. AlzPathway provides a systems-biology platform of comprehensive AD signaling and related pathways which is expected to contribute to clarification of AD pathogenesis and AD drug development.},

  abstract = {Biochemical network reconstructions have become popular tools in systems biology. Metabolicnetwork reconstructions are biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) structured databases of biochemical reactions and metabolites. They contain information such as exact reaction stoichiometry, reaction reversibility, and the relationships between genes, proteins, and reactions. Network reconstructions have been used extensively to study the phenotypic behavior of wild-type and mutant stains under a variety of conditions, linking genotypes with phenotypes. Such phenotypic simulations have allowed for the prediction of growth after genetic manipulations, prediction of growth phenotypes after adaptive evolution, and prediction of essential genes. Additionally, because network reconstructions are organism specific, they can be used to understand differences between organisms of species in a functional context.There are different types of reconstructions representing various types of biological networks (metabolic, regulatory, transcription/translation). This chapter serves as an introduction to metabolic and regulatory network reconstructions and models and gives a complete description of the core Escherichia coli metabolic model. This model can be analyzed in any computational format (such as MATLAB or Mathematica) based on the information given in this chapter. The core E. coli model is a small-scale model that can be used for educational purposes. It is meant to be used by senior undergraduate and first-year graduate students learning about constraint-based modeling and systems biology. This model has enough reactions and pathways to enable interesting and insightful calculations, but it is also simple enough that the results of such calculations can be understoodeasily.},

However, since our knowledge of any organism is incomplete, these network reconstructions contain gaps. Reactions may be missing, resulting in dead-ends in pathways, while unknown gene products may catalyze known reactions. New computational methods that analyze data, such as growth phenotypes or gene essentiality, in the context of genome-scale metabolic networks, have been developed to predict these missing reactions or genes likely to fill these knowledge gaps. A growing number of experimental studies are appearing that address these computational predictions, leading to discovery of new metabolic capabilities in the target organism. Gap-filling methods can thus be used to improve metabolic network models while simultaneously leading to discovery of new metabolic gene functions. Biotechnol.

  abstract = {The Disease Maps Project builds on a network of scientific and clinical groups that exchange best practices, share information and develop systems biomedicine tools. The project aims for an integrated, highly curated and user-friendly platform for disease-related knowledge. The primary focus of disease maps is on interconnected signaling, metabolic and gene regulatory network pathways represented in standard formats. The involvement of domain experts ensures that the key disease hallmarks are covered and relevant, up-to-date knowledge is adequately represented. Expert-curated and computer readable, disease maps may serve as a compendium of knowledge, allow for data-supported hypothesis generation or serve as a scaffold for the generation of predictive mathematical models. This article summarizes the 2nd Disease Maps Community meeting, highlighting its important topics and outcomes. We outline milestones on the roadmap for the future development of disease maps, including creating and maintaining standardized disease maps; sharing parts of maps that encode common human disease mechanisms; providing technical solutions for complexity management of maps; and Web tools for in-depth exploration of such maps. A dedicated discussion was focused on mathematical modeling approaches, as one of the main goals of disease map development is the generation of mathematically interpretable representations to predict disease comorbidity or drug response and to suggest drug repositioning, altogether supporting clinical decisions.},

  abstract = {Metabolic network reconstructions are often incomplete. Constraint-based and pattern-based methodologies have been used for automated gap filling of these networks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, since validation of hypotheses made by gap filling tools require experimentation, it is challenging to benchmark performance and make improvements other than that related to speed and scalability.We present BoostGAPFILL, an open source tool that leverages both constraint-based and machine learning methodologies for hypotheses generation in gap filling and metabolic model refinement. BoostGAPFILL uses metabolite patterns in the incomplete network captured using a matrix factorization formulation to constrain the set of reactions used to fill gaps in a metabolic network. We formulate a testing framework based on the available metabolic reconstructions and demonstrate the superiority of BoostGAPFILL to state-of-the-art gap filling tools. We randomly delete a number of reactions from a metabolic network and rate the different algorithms on their ability to both predict the deleted reactions from a universal set and to fill gaps. For most metabolic network reconstructions tested, BoostGAPFILL shows above 60\% precision and recall, which is more than twice that of other existing tools.MATLAB open source implementation (https://github.com/Tolutola/BoostGAPFILL)Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The overview is automatically created from a Pathway/Genome Database describing that organism.

Pathway Tools supports interrogation and exploration of cellular biochemical networks through the overview diagram. Furthermore, a software component called the Omics Viewer provides visual analysis of whole-organism datasets using the overview diagram as an organizing framework. For example, gene expression and metabolomics measurements, alone or in combination, can be painted onto the overview, as can computed whole-organism datasets, such as predicted reaction-flux values. The cellular overview and Omics Viewer provide a mechanism whereby biologists can apply the pattern-recognition capabilities of the human visual system to analyze large-scale datasets in a biologically meaningful context. SRI's BioCyc.org website provides overview diagrams for more than 200 organisms. This article describes enhancements to the overview made since a 1999 publication, including the automatic layout capability, expansion of the cellular machinery that it includes, new semantic zooming and poster-generating capabilities, and extension of the Omics Viewer to support painting of metabolites, animations and zooming to individual pathway diagrams.},

  abstract = {Learning on sets is increasingly gaining attention in the machine learning community, due to its widespread applicability. Typically, representations over sets are computed by using fixed aggregation functions such as sum or maximum. However, recent results showed that universal function representation by sum- (or max-) decomposition requires either highly discontinuous (and thus poorly learnable) mappings, or a latent dimension equal to the maximum number of elements in the set. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a learnable aggregation function (LAF) for sets of arbitrary cardinality. LAF can approximate several extensively used aggregators (such as average, sum, maximum) as well as more complex functions (e.g., variance and skewness). We report experiments on semi-synthetic and real data showing that LAF outperforms state-of-the-art sum- (max-) decomposition architectures such as DeepSets and librarybased architectures like Principal Neighborhood Aggregation, and can be effectively combined with attention-based architectures.},

We propose a biologically motivated quantity, twinness, to evaluate local similarity between nodes in a network. The twinness of a pair of nodes is the number of connected, labeled subgraphs of size n in which the two nodes possess identical neighbours. The graph animal algorithm is used to estimate twinness for each pair of nodes (for subgraph sizes n=4 to n=12) in four different protein interaction networks (PINs). These include an Escherichia coli PIN and three Saccharomyces cerevisiae PINs — each obtained using state-of-the-art high-throughput methods. In almost all cases, the average twinness of node pairs is vastly higher than that expected from a null model obtained by switching links. For all n, we observe a difference in the ratio of type A twins (which are unlinked pairs) to type B twins (which are linked pairs) distinguishing the prokaryote E. coli from the eukaryote S. cerevisiae. Interaction similarity is expected due to gene duplication, and whole genome duplication paralogues in S. cerevisiae have been reported to co-cluster into the same complexes. Indeed, we find that these paralogous proteins are over-represented as twins compared to pairs chosen at random. These results indicate that twinness can detect ancestral relationships from currently available PIN data.},

Rev. Neurosci.10, 186–198. (doi:10.1038/nrn2618)). Traditionally, the structure of complex networks has been studied through their statistical properties and metrics concerned with node and link properties, e.g. degree-distribution, node centrality and modularity. Here, we study the characteristics of functional brain networks at the mesoscopic level from a novel perspective that highlights the role of inhomogeneities in the fabric of functional connections. This can be done by focusing on the features of a set of topological objects—homological cycles—associated with the weighted functional network. We leverage the detected topological information to define the homological scaffolds, a new set of objects designed to represent compactly the homological features of the correlation network and simultaneously make their homological properties amenable to networks theoretical methods. As a proof of principle, we apply these tools to compare resting-state functional brain activity in 15 healthy volunteers after intravenous infusion of placebo and psilocybin—the main psychoactive component of magic mushrooms. The results show that the homological structure of the brain's functional patterns undergoes a dramatic change post-psilocybin, characterized by the appearance of many transient structures of low stability and of a small number of persistent ones that are not observed in the case of placebo.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized bio-logical discovery, providing an unbiased picture of cellular heterogeneity in tissues. While scRNA-seq has been used extensively to provide insight into health and disease, it has not been used for disease prediction or diagnostics. Graph Attention Networks have proven to be versatile for a wide range of tasks by learning from both original features and graph structures. Here we present a graph attention model for predicting disease state from single-cell data on a large dataset of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. MS is a disease of the central nervous system that is difficult to diagnose. We train our model on single-cell data obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for a cohort of seven MS patients and six healthy adults (HA), resulting in 66,667 individual cells. We achieve 92\% accuracy in predicting MS, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as a graph convolutional network, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron. Further, we use the learned graph attention model to get insight into the features (cell types and genes) that are important for this prediction. The graph attention model also allow us to infer a new feature space for the cells that emphasizes the difference between the two conditions. Finally we use the attention weights to learn a new low-dimensional embedding which we visualize with PHATE and UMAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use graph attention, and deep learning in general, to predict disease state from single-cell data. We envision applying this method to single-cell data for other diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diverse datasets, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data, are becoming readily available for specific organisms. There is currently a need to integrate these datasets within an in silico modeling framework. Constraint-based models of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 have been developed and used to study the bacterium's metabolism and phenotypic behavior. The most comprehensive E. coli model to date (E. coli iJE660a GSM) accounts for 660 genes and includes 627 unique biochemical reactions. RESULTS: An expanded genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (iJR904 GSM/GPR) has been reconstructed which includes 904 genes and 931 unique biochemical reactions. The reactions in the expanded model are both elementally and charge balanced. Network gap analysis led to putative assignments for 55 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene to protein to reaction associations (GPR) are now directly included in the model. Comparisons between predictions made by iJR904 and iJE660a models show that they are generally similar but differ under certain circumstances. Analysis of genome-scale proton balancing shows how the flux of protons into and out of the medium is important for maximizing cellular growth. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli iJR904 has improved capabilities over iJE660a. iJR904 is a more complete and chemically accurate description of E. coli metabolism than iJE660a. Perhaps most importantly, iJR904 can be used for analyzing and integrating the diverse datasets. iJR904 will help to outline the genotype-phenotype relationship for E. coli K-12, as it can account for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and fluxomic data simultaneously.},

Signaling pathways are often represented as directed graphs, which are not adequate for modeling reactions such as complex assembly and dissociation, combinatorial regulation, and protein activation/inactivation. More accurate representations such as directed hypergraphs remain underutilized. In this paper, we present an extension of a directed hypergraph that we call a signaling hypergraph. We formulate a problem that asks what proteins and interactions must be involved in order to stimulate a specific response downstream of a signaling pathway. We relate this problem to computing the shortest acyclic B-hyperpath in a signaling hypergraph --- an NP-hard problem --- and present a mixed integer linear program to solve it. We demonstrate that the shortest hyperpaths computed in signaling hypergraphs are far more informative than shortest paths found in corresponding graph representations. Our results illustrate the potential of signaling hypergraphs as an improved representation of signaling pathways and motivate the development of novel hypergraph algorithms.},

Instead, we propose a strategy to exploit diagnoses as relational information by connecting similar patients in a graph. To this end, we propose LSTM-GNN for patient outcome prediction tasks: a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for extracting temporal features and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting the patient neighbourhood information. We demonstrate that LSTM-GNNs outperform the LSTM-only baseline on length of stay prediction tasks on the eICU database.

  author = {Romano, Simone and Bailey, James and Vinh, Nguyen Xuan and Verspoor, Karin},
  pages = {9},
  abstract = {Mutual information is a very popular measure for comparing clusterings. Previous work has shown that it is beneficial to make an adjustment for chance to this measure, by subtracting an expected value and normalizing via an upper bound. This yields the constant baseline property that enhances intuitiveness. In this paper, we argue that a further type of statistical adjustment for the mutual information is also beneficial – an adjustment to correct selection bias. This type of adjustment is useful when carrying out many clustering comparisons, to select one or more preferred clusterings. It reduces the tendency for the mutual information to choose clustering solutions i) with more clusters, or ii) induced on fewer data points, when compared to a reference one. We term our new adjusted measure the standardized mutual information. It requires computation of the variance of mutual information under a hypergeometric model of randomness, which is technically challenging. We derive an analytical formula for this variance and analyze its complexity. We then experimentally assess how our new measure can address selection bias and also increase interpretability. We recommend using the standardized mutual information when making multiple clustering comparisons in situations where the number of records is small compared to the number of clusters considered.},

  abstract = {Modern graph embedding procedures can efficiently extract features of nodes from graphs with millions of nodes. e features are later used as inputs for downstream predictive tasks. In this paper we propose GEMSEC a graph embedding algorithm which learns a clustering of the nodes simultaneously with computing their features. e procedure places nodes in an abstract feature space where the vertex features minimize the negative log likelihood of preserving sampled vertex neighborhoods, while the nodes are clustered into a fixed number of groups in this space. GEMSEC is a general extension of earlier work in the domain as it is an augmentation of the core optimization problem of sequence based graph embedding procedures and is agnostic of the neighborhood sampling strategy. We show that GEMSEC extracts high quality clusters on real world social networks and is competitive with other community detection algorithms. We demonstrate that the clustering constraint has a positive effect on representation quality and also that our procedure learns to embed and cluster graphs jointly in a robust and scalable manner.},

How drugs restore these functions, however, is often unknown as a drug’s therapeutic effects are not limited to the proteins that the drug directly targets. Here, we develop the multiscale interactome, a powerful approach to explain disease treatment. We integrate disease-perturbed proteins, drug targets, and biological functions into a multiscale interactome network. We then develop a random walk-based method that captures how drug effects propagate through a hierarchy of biological functions and physical protein-protein interactions. On three key pharmacological tasks, the multiscale interactome predicts drug-disease treatment, identifies proteins and biological functions related to treatment, and predicts genes that alter a treatment’s efficacy and adverse reactions. Our results indicate that physical interactions between proteins alone cannot explain treatment since many drugs treat diseases by affecting the biological functions disrupted by the disease rather than directly targeting disease proteins or their regulators. We provide a general framework for explaining treatment, even when drugs seem unrelated to the diseases they are recommended for.},

  abstract = {Auto-encoders have emerged as a successful framework for unsupervised learning. However, conventional autoencoders are incapable of utilizing explicit relations in structured data. To take advantage of relations in graph-structured data, several graph auto-encoders have recently been proposed, but they neglect to reconstruct either the graph structure or node attributes. In this paper, we present the graph attention autoencoder (GATE), a neural network architecture for unsupervised representation learning on graph-structured data. Our architecture is able to reconstruct graph-structured inputs, including both node attributes and the graph structure, through stacked encoder/decoder layers equipped with self-attention mechanisms. In the encoder, by considering node attributes as initial node representations, each layer generates new representations of nodes by attending over their neighbors’ representations. In the decoder, we attempt to reverse the encoding process to reconstruct node attributes. Moreover, node representations are regularized to reconstruct the graph structure. Our proposed architecture does not need to know the graph structure upfront, and thus it can be applied to inductive learning. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance on several node classification benchmark datasets for transductive and inductive tasks, even exceeding the performance of supervised learning baselines in most cases.},

  abstract = {Interpretability of machine learning models is critical to scientific understanding, AI safety, and debugging. Attribution is one approach to interpretability, which highlights input dimensions that are influential to a neural network’s prediction. Evaluation of these methods is largely qualitative for image and text models, because acquiring ground truth attributions requires expensive and unreliable human judgment. Attribution has been comparatively understudied for graph neural networks (GNNs), a model class of growing importance that makes predictions on arbitrarily-sized graphs. Graph-valued data offer an opportunity to quantitatively benchmark attribution methods, because challenging synthetic graph problems have computable ground-truth attributions. In this work we adapt commonly-used attribution methods for GNNs and quantitatively evaluate them using the axes of attribution accuracy, stability, faithfulness and consistency. We make concrete recommendations for which attribution methods to use, and provide the data and code for our benchmarking suite. Rigorous and open source benchmarking of attribution methods in graphs could enable new methods development and broader use of attribution in real-world ML tasks.},

Despite the great effort invested in their creation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata) remain incomplete. We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link prediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples) and entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to deal with the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved by enriching them with an encoder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the relational graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29.8\% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline.},

We introduce EMOGI, an explainable machine learning method based on graph convolutional networks to predict cancer genes by combining multiomics pan-cancer data—such as mutations, copy number changes, DNA methylation and gene expression—together with protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. EMOGI was on average more accurate than other methods across different PPI networks and datasets. We used layer-wise relevance propagation to stratify genes according to whether their classification was driven by the interactome or any of the omics levels, and to identify important modules in the PPI network. We propose 165 novel cancer genes that do not necessarily harbour recurrent alterations but interact with known cancer genes, and we show that they correspond to essential genes from loss-of-function screens. We believe that our method can open new avenues in precision oncology and be applied to predict biomarkers for other complex diseases.},

Genome-scale metabolic modeling is ever increasingly used tool for biomedical applications including the elucidation of antibiotic resistance, virulence, single pathogen mechanisms and pathogen-host interaction systems. With this approach, the sophisticated cellular system of metabolic reactions inside the pathogens as well as between pathogen and host cells are represented in conjunction with their corresponding genes and enzymes. Along with essential metabolic reactions, alternate pathways and fluxes are predicted by performing computational flux analyses for the growth of pathogens in a very short time. The genes or enzymes responsible for the essential metabolic reactions in pathogen growth are regarded as potential drug targets, as a priori guide to researchers in the pharmaceutical field. Pathogens alter the key metabolic processes in infected host, ultimately the objective of these integrative constraint-based context-specific metabolic models is to provide novel insights toward understanding the metabolic basis of the acute and chronic processes of infection, revealing cellular mechanisms of pathogenesis, identifying strain-specific biomarkers and developing new therapeutic approaches including the combination drugs. The reaction rates predicted during different time points of pathogen development enable us to predict active pathways and those that only occur during certain stages of infection, and thus point out the putative drug targets. Among others, fatty acid and lipid syntheses reactions are recent targets of new antimicrobial drugs. Genome-scale metabolic models provide an improved understanding of how intracellular pathogens utilize the existing microenvironment of the host. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge of genome-scale metabolic modeling in pathogen cells as well as pathogen host interaction systems and the promising applications in the extension of curative strategies against pathogens for global preventative healthcare.},

  abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental problem in machine learning. While deep learning has shown great promise in many graphrelated tasks, developing neural models for community detection has received surprisingly little attention. The few existing approaches focus on detecting disjoint communities, even though communities in real graphs are well known to be overlapping. We address this shortcoming and propose a graph neural network (GNN) based model for overlapping community detection. Despite its simplicity, our model outperforms the existing baselines by a large margin in the task of community recovery. We establish through an extensive experimental evaluation that the proposed model is effective, scalable and robust to hyperparameter settings. We also perform an ablation study that confirms that GNN is the key ingredient to the power of the proposed model.

This makes ever more evident the necessity for an effective automated layout that can replicate high-quality manually drawn diagrams. The complexity and idiosyncrasies of these diagrams, as well as the specific tasks the end users perform with them, mean that a layout must meet many requirements beyond the simple metrics used in existing automated computational approaches. In this paper we outline these requirements, examine existing ones and describe new ones. We demonstrate state-of-the-art layout techniques enhanced with novel functionalities to meet part of the requirements.

GSMs provide a mechanistic link between cellular genotypes and metabolic phenotypes, and are thus widely used to analyze metabolism at the systems level. GSMs consist of hundreds or thousands of reactions. They have thus largely been analyzed with computationally efficient constraint-based methods such as flux-balance analysis, limiting their scope and phenotype prediction accuracy. Computationally more demanding but potentially more informative methods, such as kinetic and dynamic modeling, are currently limited to small or medium-sized models. Thus, it is desirable to achieve unbiased stoichiometric reductions of large-scale metabolic models to small, coarse-grained model representations that capture significant metabolic modules. Here, we review published automated and semiautomated methods used for large-scale metabolic model reduction. The top-down methods discussed provide minimal networks that retain a set of user-protected phenotypes, but may reduce the model's metabolic and phenotypic versatility. In contrast, the two bottom-up approaches reviewed retain a more unbiased set of phenotypes; at the same time, these methods require the partitioning of the GSM into metabolic subsystems by the user, and make strong assumptions on the subsystems' connections and their states, respectively.},

  abstract = {Over the recent years, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly popular in network analytic and beyond. With that, their architecture noticeable diverges from the classical multi-layered hierarchical organization of the traditional neural networks. At the same time, many conventional approaches in network science efficiently utilize the hierarchical approaches to account for the hierarchical organization of the networks, and recent works emphasize their critical importance. This paper aims to connect the dots between the traditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well as the network science approaches, harnessing the power of the hierarchical network organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is proposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of auxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the node features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer as well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous learning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network features at variable resolution and uses them to improve the convergence and stability of the individual node feature learning. The proposed Hierarchical Graph Neural network architecture is successfully evaluated on the network embedding and modeling as well as network classification, node labeling, and community tasks and demonstrates increased efficiency in those.},

This optimization appears to be a complex problem traditionally relying on discrete heuristics. And although the problem could be reformulated as continuous optimization, direct application of the standard optimization methods has limited efficiency in overcoming the numerous local extrema. However, the rise of deep learning and its applications to graphs offers new opportunities. And while graph neural networks have been used for supervised and unsupervised learning on networks, their application to modularity optimization has not been explored yet. This paper proposes a new variant of the recurrent graph neural network algorithm for unsupervised network community detection through modularity optimization.

The approach also serves as a proof-of-concept for the broader application of recurrent graph neural networks to unsupervised network optimization.},

  abstract = {Background The interplay between metabolic processes and signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Global, detailed and comprehensive reconstructions of human metabolism and signalling pathways exist in the form of molecular maps, but they have never been integrated together. We aim at filling in this gap by integrating of both signalling and metabolic pathways allowing a visual exploration of multi-level omics data and study of cross-regulatory circuits between these processes in health and in disease. Results We combined two comprehensive manually curated network maps. Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), containing mechanisms frequently implicated in cancer; and ReconMap~2.0, a comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolic network. We linked ACSN and ReconMap~2.0 maps via common players and represented the two maps as interconnected layers using the NaviCell platform for maps exploration (https://navicell.curie.fr/pages/maps\_ReconMap\%202.html). In addition, proteins catalysing metabolic reactions in ReconMap~2.0 were not previously visually represented on the map canvas. This precluded visualisation of omics data in the context of ReconMap~2.0. We suggested a solution for displaying protein nodes on the ReconMap~2.0 map in the vicinity of the corresponding reaction or process nodes. This permits multi-omics data visualisation in the context of both map layers. Exploration and shuttling between the two map layers is possible using Google Maps-like features of NaviCell. The integrated networks ACSN-ReconMap~2.0 are accessible online and allows data visualisation through various modes such as markers, heat maps, bar-plots, glyphs and map staining. The integrated networks were applied for comparison of immunoreactive and proliferative ovarian cancer subtypes using transcriptomic, copy number and mutation multi-omics data. A certain number of metabolic and signalling processes specifically deregulated in each of the ovarian cancer sub-types were identified. Conclusions As knowledge evolves and new omics data becomes more heterogeneous, gathering together existing domains of biology under common platforms is essential. We believe that an integrated ACSN-ReconMap~2.0 networks will help in understanding various disease mechanisms and discovery of new interactions at the intersection of cell signalling and metabolism. In addition, the successful integration of metabolic and signalling networks allows broader systems biology approach application for data interpretation and retrieval of intervention points to tackle simultaneously the key players coordinating signalling and metabolism in human diseases.

While there is general agreement regarding the qualitative properties of a biochemical module, there is no clear consensus on the quantitative criteria that may be used to systematically derive these modules. In this work, we investigate cyclical interactions as the defining characteristic of a biochemical module. We utilize a round trip distance metric, termed Shortest Retroactive Distance (ShReD), to characterize the retroactive connectivity between any two reactions in a biochemical network and to group together network components that mutually influence each other. We evaluate the metric on two types of networks that feature feedback interactions: (i) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and (ii) liver metabolism supporting drug transformation. For both networks, the ShReD partitions found hierarchically arranged modules that confirm biological intuition. In addition, the partitions also revealed modules that are less intuitive. In particular, ShReD-based partition of the metabolic network identified a ‘redox’ module that couples reactions of glucose, pyruvate, lipid and drug metabolism through shared production and consumption of NADPH. Our results suggest that retroactive interactions arising from feedback loops and metabolic cycles significantly contribute to the modularity of biochemical networks. For metabolic networks, cofactors play an important role as allosteric effectors that mediate the retroactive interactions.},

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

During fine-tuning on molecules with unknown geometry, the GNN still generates implicit 3D information and can use it to improve downstream tasks.

Hence, a comprehensive overview of community detection's latest progress through deep learning is timely to both academics and practitioners. This survey devises and proposes a new taxonomy covering different categories of the state-of-the-art methods, including deep learning-based models upon deep neural networks, deep nonnegative matrix factorization and deep sparse filtering. The main category, i.e., deep neural networks, is further divided into convolutional networks, graph attention networks, generative adversarial networks and autoencoders. The survey also summarizes the popular benchmark data sets, model evaluation metrics, and open-source implementations to address experimentation settings. We then discuss the practical applications of community detection in various domains and point to implementation scenarios.

  abstract = {Network representation learning (NRL) is an effective graph analytics technique and promotes users to deeply understand the hidden characteristics of graph data. It has been successfully applied in many real-world tasks related to network science, such as social network data processing, biological information processing, and recommender systems. Deep Learning is a powerful tool to learn data features. However, it is non-trivial to generalize deep learning to graph-structured data since it is different from the regular data such as pictures having spatial information and sounds having temporal information. Recently, researchers proposed many deep learning-based methods in the area of NRL. In this survey, we investigate classical NRL from traditional feature learning method to the deep learning-based model, analyze relationships between them, and summarize the latest progress. Finally, we discuss open issues considering NRL and point out the future directions in this field.},

  abstract = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has experienced great success in graph analysis tasks. It works by smoothing the node features across the graph. The current GCN models overwhelmingly assume that node feature information is complete. However, real-world graph data are often incomplete and containing missing features. Traditionally, people have to estimate and fill in the unknown features based on imputation techniques and then apply GCN. However, the process of feature filling and graph learning are separated, resulting in degraded and unstable performance. This problem becomes more serious when a large number of features are missing. We propose an approach that adapts GCN to graphs containing missing features. In contrast to traditional strategy, our approach integrates the processing of missing features and graph learning within the same neural network architecture. Our idea is to represent the missing data by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and calculate the expected activation of neurons in the first hidden layer of GCN, while keeping the other layers of the network unchanged. This enables us to learn the GMM parameters and network weight parameters in an end-to-end manner. Notably, our approach does not increase the computational complexity of GCN and it is consistent with GCN when the features are complete. We conduct experiments on the node label classification task and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the best imputation based methods by up to 99.43\%, 102.96\%, 6.97\%, 35.36\% in four benchmark graphs when a large portion of features are missing. The performance of our approach for the case with a low level of missing features is even superior to GCN for the case with complete features.},

We provide methodology-based taxonomies that classify static and dynamic community detection methods into hierarchically nested, fine-grained, and specific classes. We classify the methods into the objective function they optimize. Each objective function class is classified into clustering categories. Each category is further classified into clustering methods. Methods are further classified into sub-methods and so on. Thus, the lowest subclass in a hierarchy is a fine-grained and specific method. For each method, we survey the different techniques in literature employed by the method. We empirically and experimentally compare and rank the different methods that fall under each clustering category. We also empirically and experimentally compare and rank the different categories that optimize a same objective function. In summary, the block-based, top-down divisive-based, random walk-based, and matrix eigenvector-based methods achieved good results. Finally, we provide fitness metrics for each objective function.},

To address this problem, metabolic network reductions can substantially reduce the overwhelming size of the problem instances at hand. We begin by formulating some reasonable axioms defining what it means for a metabolic network reduction to be “canonical” which conceptually enforces reversibility without loss of any information on the feasible flux distributions. Then, we start to search for an efficient way to deduce some of the attributes of the original network from the reduced one in order to improve the performance. As the next step, we will demonstrate how to reduce a metabolic network repeatedly until no more reductions are possible. In the end, we sum up by pointing out some of the biological implications of this study apart from the computational aspects discussed earlier.},

The analysis of such metrics and its significance must be interpreted correctly for evaluating different learning algorithms. Most of these measures are scalar metrics and some of them are graphical methods. This paper introduces a detailed overview of the classification assessment measures with the aim of providing the basics of these measures and to show how it works to serve as a comprehensive source for researchers who are interested in this field. This overview starts by highlighting the definition of the confusion matrix in binary and multi-class classification problems. Many classification measures are also explained in details, and the influence of balanced and imbalanced data on each metric is presented. An illustrative example is introduced to show (1) how to calculate these measures in binary and multi-class classification problems, and (2) the robustness of some measures against balanced and imbalanced data. Moreover, some graphical measures such as Receiver operating characteristics (ROC), Precision-Recall, and Detection error trade-off (DET) curves are presented with details. Additionally, in a step-by-step approach, different numerical examples are demonstrated to explain the preprocessing steps of plotting ROC, PR, and DET curves.},

In this work, we explore the possibility of employing deep learning in graph clustering. We propose a simple method, which first learns a nonlinear embedding of the original graph by stacked autoencoder, and then runs k-means algorithm on the embedding to obtain clustering result. We show that this simple method has solid theoretical foundation, due to the similarity between autoencoder and spectral clustering in terms of what they actually optimize. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient and flexible than spectral clustering. First, the computational complexity of autoencoder is much lower than spectral clustering: the former can be linear to the number of nodes in a sparse graph while the latter is super quadratic due to eigenvalue decomposition. Second, when additional sparsity constraint is imposed, we can simply employ the sparse autoencoder developed in the literature of deep learning; however, it is nonstraightforward to implement a sparse spectral method. The experimental results on various graph datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional spectral clustering, which clearly indicates the effectiveness of deep learning in graph clustering.},

To explore the origin of phosphorus-dependent metabolism, the present study constructs a protometabolic network that contains phosphates prebiotically available using computational systems biology approaches. It is found that some primitive phosphorylated intermediates could greatly alleviate thermodynamic bottlenecks of network expansion. Moreover, the phosphorus-dependent metabolic network exhibits several ancient features. Taken together, it is concluded that phosphates played a role as important as that of thioesters during the origin and evolution of metabolism. Both phosphorus and sulfur are speculated to be critical to the origin of life.},

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the development of Graph Neural Drawers (GND), machines that rely on neural computation for constructing efficient and complex maps. GND are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) whose learning process can be driven by any provided loss function, such as the ones commonly employed in Graph Drawing. Moreover, we prove that this mechanism can be guided by loss functions computed by means of Feedforward Neural Networks, on the basis of supervision hints that express beauty properties, like the minimization of crossing edges. In this context, we show that GNNs can nicely be enriched by positional features to deal also with unlabelled vertexes. We provide a proof-of-concept by constructing a loss function for the edge-crossing and provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons among different GNN models working under the proposed framework.},

This complex ecosystem is an integral part of the gastrointestinal tract and plays a major role in the maintenance of homeostasis. Its dysfunction has been correlated to a wide array of diseases, but the understanding of causal mechanisms is hampered by the limited amount of cultured microbes, poor understanding of phenotypes, and the limited knowledge about interspecies interactions. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) have been used in many different fields, ranging from metabolic engineering to the prediction of interspecies interactions. We provide showcase examples for the application of GEMs for gut microbes and focus on (i) the prediction of minimal, synthetic, or defined media; (ii) the prediction of possible functions and phenotypes; and (iii) the prediction of interspecies interactions. All three applications are key in understanding the role of individual species in the gut ecosystem as well as the role of the microbiota as a whole. Using GEMs in the described fashions has led to designs of minimal growth media, an increased understanding of microbial phenotypes and their influence on the host immune system, and dietary interventions to improve human health. Ultimately, an increased understanding of the gut ecosystem will enable targeted interventions in gut microbial composition to restore homeostasis and appropriate host-microbe crosstalk.},

By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically applied to static graphs that are assumed to be known upfront. This static input structure is often informed purely by insight of the machine learning practitioner, and might not be optimal for the actual task the GNN is solving. In absence of reliable domain expertise, one might resort to inferring the latent graph structure, which is often difficult due to the vast search space of possible graphs. Here we introduce Pointer Graph Networks (PGNs) which augment sets or graphs with additional inferred edges for improved model generalisation ability. PGNs allow each node to dynamically point to another node, followed by message passing over these pointers. The sparsity of this adaptable graph structure makes learning tractable while still being sufficiently expressive to simulate complex algorithms. Critically, the pointing mechanism is directly supervised to model long-term sequences of operations on classical data structures, incorporating useful structural inductive biases from theoretical computer science. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that PGNs can learn parallelisable variants of pointer-based data structures, namely disjoint set unions and link/cut trees. PGNs generalise out-of-distribution to 5× larger test inputs on dynamic graph connectivity tasks, outperforming unrestricted GNNs and Deep Sets.},

Yet, this analysis is not amenable in the context of graph learning, as graphs usually belong to different metric spaces. We fill this gap by proposing a new online Graph Dictionary Learning approach, which uses the Gromov Wasserstein divergence for the data fitting term. In our work, graphs are encoded through their nodes’ pairwise relations and modeled as convex combination of graph atoms, i.e. dictionary elements, estimated thanks to an online stochastic algorithm, which operates on a dataset of unregistered graphs with potentially different number of nodes. Our approach naturally extends to labeled graphs, and is completed by a novel upper bound that can be used as a fast approximation of Gromov Wasserstein in the embedding space. We provide numerical evidences showing the interest of our approach for unsupervised embedding of graph datasets and for online graph subspace estimation and tracking.},

Biological pathways are an example of complex real-world networks, where vertices represent biological entities, and edges indicate the underlying connectivity. For this reason, using multilayer networks to model biological knowledge allows us to formally cover essential properties and theories in the field, which also raises challenges in visualization. This is because, in the early days of pathway visualization research, only restricted types of graphs, such as simple graphs, clustered graphs, and others were adopted. In this paper, we revisit a heterogeneous definition of biological networks and aim to provide an overview to see the gaps between data modeling and visual representation. The contribution will, therefore, lie in providing guidelines and challenges of using multilayer networks as a unified data structure for the biological pathway visualization.},

  abstract = {Graph clustering is a fundamental task which discovers communities or groups in networks. Recent studies have mostly focused on developing deep learning approaches to learn a compact graph embedding, upon which classic clustering methods like k-means or spectral clustering algorithms are applied. These two-step frameworks are difficult to manipulate and usually lead to suboptimal performance, mainly because the graph embedding is not goal-directed, i.e., designed for the specific clustering task. In this paper, we propose a goal-directed deep learning approach, Deep Attentional Embedded Graph Clustering (DAEGC for short). Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. By employing an attention network to capture the importance of the neighboring nodes to a target node, our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph to a compact representation, on which an inner product decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels from the graph embedding itself are generated to supervise a self-training graph clustering process, which iteratively refines the clustering results. The selftraining process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding in a unified framework, to mutually benefit both components. Experimental results compared with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.},

Wet-lab screening of SL pairs is afflicted with high cost, batch-effect, and off-target problems. Current computational methods for SL prediction include gene knock-out simulation, knowledge-based data mining and machine learning methods. Most of the existing methods tend to assume that SL pairs are independent of each other, without taking into account the shared biological mechanisms underlying the SL pairs. Although several methods have incorporated genomic and proteomic data to aid SL prediction, these methods involve manual feature engineering that heavily relies on domain knowledge.Here, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based model, named KG4SL, by incorporating knowledge graph (KG) message-passing into SL prediction. The KG was constructed using 11 kinds of entities including genes, compounds, diseases, biological processes and 24 kinds of relationships that could be pertinent to SL. The integration of KG can help harness the independence issue and circumvent manual feature engineering by conducting message-passing on the KG. Our model outperformed all the state-of-the-art baselines in area under the curve, area under precision-recall curve and F1. Extensive experiments, including the comparison of our model with an unsupervised TransE model, a vanilla graph convolutional network model, and their combination, demonstrated the significant impact of incorporating KG into GNN for SL prediction.: KG4SL is freely available at https://github.com/JieZheng-ShanghaiTech/KG4SL.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Recently, graph clustering has moved from traditional shallow methods to deep learning approaches, thanks to the unique feature representation learning capability of deep learning. However, existing deep approaches for graph clustering can only exploit the structure information, while ignoring the content information associated with the nodes in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel marginalized graph autoencoder (MGAE) algorithm for graph clustering. e key innovation of MGAE is that it advances the autoencoder to the graph domain, so graph representation learning can be carried out not only in a purely unsupervised se ing by leveraging structure and content information, it can also be stacked in a deep fashion to learn e ective representation. From a technical viewpoint, we propose a marginalized graph convolutional network to corrupt network node content, allowing node content to interact with network features, and marginalizes the corrupted features in a graph autoencoder context to learn graph feature representations. e learned features are fed into the spectral clustering algorithm for graph clustering. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MGAE, compared to numerous baselines.},

  abstract = {RAVEN is a commonly used MATLAB toolbox for genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) reconstruction, curation and constraint-based modelling and simulation. Here we present RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) de novo reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with the COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 are here illustrated through de novo reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Comparison of the automated de novo reconstructions with the iMK1208 model, a previously published high-quality S. coelicolor GEM, exemplifies that RAVEN 2.0 can capture most of the manually curated model. The generated de novo reconstruction is subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of S. coelicolor, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allows the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production. As such, we demonstrate that RAVEN 2.0 can be used not only for de novo GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases. Both RAVEN 2.0 and Sco4 are distributed through GitHub to facilitate usage and further development by the community (https:// github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN and https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/ Streptomyces\_coelicolor-GEM).},

We introduce the scGNN (single-cell graph neural network) to provide a hypothesis-free deep learning framework for scRNA-Seq analyses. This framework formulates and aggregates cell–cell relationships with graph neural networks and models heterogeneous gene expression patterns using a left-truncated mixture Gaussian model. scGNN integrates three iterative multi-modal autoencoders and outperforms existing tools for gene imputation and cell clustering on four benchmark scRNA-Seq datasets. In an Alzheimer’s disease study with 13,214 single nuclei from postmortem brain tissues, scGNN successfully illustrated disease-related neural development and the differential mechanism. scGNN provides an effective representation of gene expression and cell–cell relationships. It is also a powerful framework that can be applied to general scRNA-Seq analyses.},

Noting that the kernel matrix implicitly maps the data into a nonlinear feature space, we show how to discover a mapping that unfolds the underlying manifold from which the data was sampled. The kernel matrix is constructed by maximizing the variance in feature space subject to local constraints that preserve the angles and distances between nearest neighbors. The main optimization involves an instance of semidefinite programming---a fundamentally different computation than previous algorithms for manifold learning, such as Isomap and locally linear embedding. The optimized kernels perform better than polynomial and Gaussian kernels for problems in manifold learning, but worse for problems in large margin classification. We explain these results in terms of the geometric properties of different kernels and comment on various interpretations of other manifold learning algorithms as kernel methods.},

Most of this work relies on defining clever feature representations, in which the chemical graph structure is encoded in a uniform way such that predictions across chemical space can be made. In this work, we propose to exploit the powerful ability of deep neural networks to learn a feature representation from low-level encodings of a huge corpus of chemical structures. Our model borrows ideas from neural machine translation: it translates between two semantically equivalent but syntactically different representations of molecular structures, compressing the meaningful information both representations have in common in a low-dimensional representation vector. Once the model is trained, this representation can be extracted for any new molecule and utilized as a descriptor. In fair benchmarks with respect to various human-engineered molecular fingerprints and graph-convolution models, our method shows competitive performance in modelling quantitative structure–activity relationships in all analysed datasets. Additionally, we show that our descriptor significantly outperforms all baseline molecular fingerprints in two ligand-based virtual screening tasks. Overall, our descriptors show the most consistent performances in all experiments. The continuity of the descriptor space and the existence of the decoder that permits deducing a chemical structure from an embedding vector allow for exploration of the space and open up new opportunities for compound optimization and idea generation.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Exploring drug-protein interactions (DPIs) work as a pivotal step in drug discovery. The fast expansion of available biological data enables computational methods effectively assist in experimental methods. Among them, deep learning methods extract features only from basic characteristics, such as protein sequences, molecule structures. Others achieve significant improvement by learning from not only sequences/molecules but the protein-protein and drug-drug associations (PPAs and DDAs). The PPAs and DDAs are generally obtained by using computational methods. However, existing computational methods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that hamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel supervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby improve the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI. Results: In this research, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely BridgeDPI. BridgeDPI introduces a class of nodes named hyper-nodes, which bridge different proteins/drugs to work as PPAs and DDAs. The hyper-nodes can be supervised learned for the specific task of DPI since the whole process is an end-to-end learning. Consequently, such a model would improve prediction performance of DPI. In three real-world datasets, we further demonstrate that BridgeDPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving AUC of 0.989 (for seen proteins), 0.952 (for unseen proteins) in the customized BindingDB dataset, 0.995 in the C.elegans dataset, 0.990 in the human dataset. Moreover, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the hyper-nodes. Last, in an independent verification, BridgeDPI explores the candidate bindings among COVID-19’s proteins and various antiviral drugs. And the predictive results accord with the statement of the World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration, showing the validity and reliability of BridgeDPI. Hopefully, the BridgeDPI method will facilitate and accelerate real-world drug discovery and drug screening.

The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial–temporal GNNs. We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of GNNs. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are important tools for transductive learning tasks, such as node classification in graphs, due to their expressive power in capturing complex interdependency between nodes. To enable graph neural network learning, existing works typically assume that labeled nodes, from two or multiple classes, are provided, so that a discriminative classifier can be learned from the labeled data. In reality, this assumption might be too restrictive for applications, as users may only provide labels of interest in a single class for a small number of nodes. In addition, most GNN models only aggregate information from short distances (e.g., 1-hop neighbors) in each round, and fail to capture long distance relationship in graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network framework, long-short distance aggregation networks (LSDAN), to overcome these limitations. By generating multiple graphs at different distance levels, based on the adjacency matrix, we develop a long-short distance attention model to model these graphs. The direct neighbors are captured via a short-distance attention mechanism, and neighbors with long distance are captured by a long distance attention mechanism. Two novel risk estimators are further employed to aggregate long-short-distance networks, for PU learning and the loss is back-propagated for model learning. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

  abstract = {We present a multi-level area balancing technique for laying out clustered graphs to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships that exist in various fields, such as life sciences and sociology. Clustered graphs are often used to model relationships that are accompanied by attribute-based grouping information. Such information is essential for robust data analysis, such as for the study of biological taxonomies or educational backgrounds. Hence, the ability to smartly arrange textual labels and packing graphs within a certain screen space is therefore desired to successfully convey the attribute data . Here we propose to hierarchically partition the input screen space using Voronoi tessellations in multiple levels of detail. In our method, the position of textual labels is guided by the blending of constrained forces and the forces derived from centroidal Voronoi cells. The proposed algorithm considers three main factors: (1) area balancing, (2) schematized space partitioning, and (3) hairball management. We primarily focus on area balancing, which aims to allocate a uniform area for each textual label in the diagram. We achieve this by first untangling a general graph to a clustered graph through textual label duplication, and then coupling with spanning-tree-like visual integration. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with examples and then evaluate our method by comparing it with well-known conventional approaches and collecting feedback from domain experts.},

  abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and their variants have experienced significant attention and have become the de facto methods for learning graph representations. GCNs derive inspiration primarily from recent deep learning approaches, and as a result, may inherit unnecessary complexity and redundant computation. In this paper, we reduce this excess complexity through successively removing nonlinearities and collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers. We theoretically analyze the resulting linear model and show that it corresponds to a fixed low-pass filter followed by a linear classifier. Notably, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that these simplifications do not negatively impact accuracy in many downstream applications. Moreover, the resulting model scales to larger datasets, is naturally interpretable, and yields up to two orders of magnitude speedup over FastGCN.},

However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Hypergraphs provide a flexible and natural modeling tool to model such complex relationships. The obvious existence of such complex relationships in many real-world networks naturally motivates the problem of learning with hypergraphs. A popular learning paradigm is hypergraph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) where the goal is to assign labels to initially unlabelled vertices in a hypergraph. Motivated by the fact that a graph convolutional network (GCN) has been effective for graph-based SSL, we propose HyperGCN, a novel way of training a GCN for SSL on hypergraphs based on tools from sepctral theory of hypergraphs. We demonstrate HyperGCN’s effectiveness through detailed experimentation on real-world hypergraphs for SSL and combinatorial optimisation and analyse when it is going to be more effective than state-of-the art baselines.

Results We extracted such "common" sub-networks, defined as "phylogenetic network modules," using phylogenetic profiles and cluster analysis. The enzymes in the same "phylogenetic network module" have similar phylogenetic profiles and related functions. These modules are shown to be phylogenetic building blocks. Furthermore, the network of the modules illustrated hierarchical feature as well as the network of enzymes involved in the metabolism.

  abstract = {Most graph neural networks (GNN) perform poorly in graphs where neighbors typically have different features/classes (heterophily) and when stacking multiple layers (oversmoothing). These two seemingly unrelated problems have been studied independently, but there is recent empirical evidence that solving one problem may benefit the other. In this work, going beyond empirical observations, we theoretically characterize the connections between heterophily and oversmoothing, both of which lead to indistinguishable node representations. By modeling the change in node representations during message propagation, we theoretically analyze the factors (e.g., degree, heterophily level) that make the representations of nodes from different classes indistinguishable. Our analysis highlights that (1) nodes with high heterophily and nodes with low heterophily and low degrees relative to their neighbors (degree discrepancy) trigger the oversmoothing problem, and (2) allowing "negative" messages between neighbors can decouple the heterophily and oversmoothing problems. Based on our insights, we design a model that addresses the discrepancy in features and degrees between neighbors by incorporating signed messages and learned degree corrections. Our experiments on 9 real networks show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance under heterophily, and performs comparably to existing GNNs under low heterophily(homophily). It also effectively addresses oversmoothing and even benefits from multiple layers.},

Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial data sets spanning a wide variety of chemical end points. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary data sets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.},

When detecting communities, there are two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches. Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by finding relevant node attributes for each community.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a hot topic for their potentials in modeling the irregular data and providing state-of-the-art performance in many fields. Most of the existing GNNs are deliberately designed for semi-supervised learning tasks, where supervision information (labelled node) is utilized to mitigate the oversmoothing problem of message passing. Unfortunately, the oversmoothing problem tends to be more severe in unsupervised tasks, since supervision information is not available. Since community structure/cluster is an essential characteristic of network, a natural approach to reduce the oversmoothing problem is to also constrain the node embeddings to maintain their own characteristics to prevent all the node embeddings from becoming too similar to be distinguished. In this paper, a novel Optimal Transport based Graph Neural Network (OT-GNN) is proposed to overcome the oversmoothing problem in unsupervised GNNs by imposing the equal-sized clustering constraints to the obtained node embeddings. To solve the combinatorial optimization problem, the constrained objective function of unsupervised GNN is relaxed to an Optimal Transport problem, and a fast version of the Sinkhorm-Knopp algorithm is adopted to handle large networks. Besides of being employed to train existing GNNs, such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT), for node embedding and clustering in an unsupervised manner, OT-GNN can also be exploited to regularize other unsupervised GNNs, such as Graph AutoEncoder, for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments on node clustering, classification and link prediction demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed OT-GNN.},

GNNs combine node feature information with the graph structure by recursively passing neural messages along edges of the input graph. However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here we propose GnnExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GnnExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. Further, GnnExplainer can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances. We formulate GnnExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms alternative baseline approaches by up to 43.0\% in explanation accuracy. GnnExplainer provides a variety of benefits, from the ability to visualize semantically relevant structures to interpretability, to giving insights into errors of faulty GNNs.},

However, current GNN methods are inherently flat and do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs---a limitation that is especially problematic for the task of graph classification, where the goal is to predict the label associated with an entire graph. Here we propose DiffPool, a differentiable graph pooling module that can generate hierarchical representations of graphs and can be combined with various graph neural network architectures in an end-to-end fashion. DiffPool learns a differentiable soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a set of clusters, which then form the coarsened input for the next GNN layer. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN methods with DiffPool yields an average improvement of 5-10\% accuracy on graph classification benchmarks, compared to all existing pooling approaches, achieving a new state-of-the-art on four out of five benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {Automated function prediction (AFP) of proteins is a large-scale multi-label classification problem. Two limitations of most network-based methods for AFP are (i) a single model must be trained for each species and (ii) protein sequence information is totally ignored. These limitations cause weaker performance than sequence-based methods. Thus, the challenge is how to develop a powerful network-based method for AFP to overcome these limitations.We propose DeepGraphGO, an end-to-end, multispecies graph neural network-based method for AFP, which makes the most of both protein sequence and high-order protein network information. Our multispecies strategy allows one single model to be trained for all species, indicating a larger number of training samples than existing methods. Extensive experiments with a large-scale dataset show that DeepGraphGO outperforms a number of competing state-of-the-art methods significantly, including DeepGOPlus and three representative network-based methods: GeneMANIA, deepNF and clusDCA. We further confirm the effectiveness of our multispecies strategy and the advantage of DeepGraphGO over so-called difficult proteins. Finally, we integrate DeepGraphGO into the state-of-the-art ensemble method, NetGO, as a component and achieve a further performance improvement.https://github.com/yourh/DeepGraphGO.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has led to a growing number of new architectures as well as novel applications. However, current research focuses on proposing and evaluating specific architectural designs of GNNs, as opposed to studying the more general design space of GNNs that consists of a Cartesian product of different design dimensions, such as the number of layers or the type of the aggregation function. Additionally, GNN designs are often specialized to a single task, yet few efforts have been made to understand how to quickly find the best GNN design for a novel task or a novel dataset. Here we define and systematically study the architectural design space for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different predictive tasks. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) A general GNN design space; (2) a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for a given novel task/dataset, we can quickly identify/transfer the best performing architecture; (3) an efficient and effective design space evaluation method which allows insights to be distilled from a huge number of model-task combinations. Our key results include: (1) A comprehensive set of guidelines for designing well-performing GNNs; (2) while best GNN designs for different tasks vary significantly, the GNN task space allows for transferring the best designs across different tasks; (3) models discovered using our design space achieve state-of-the-art performance. Overall, our work offers a principled and scalable approach to transition from studying individual GNN designs for specific tasks, to systematically studying the GNN design space and the task space. Finally, we release GraphGym, a powerful platform for exploring different GNN designs and tasks. GraphGym features modularized GNN implementation, standardized GNN evaluation, and reproducible and scalable experiment management.},

  abstract = {Message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful modeling framework for relational data. However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d-regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40\% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3\% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15\% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks. Additionally, ID-GNNs demonstrate improved or comparable performance over other task-specific graph networks.},

  abstract = {NF-κB pathway consists of canonical and non-canonical pathways. The canonical NF-κB is activated by various stimuli, transducing a quick but transient transcriptional activity, to regulate the expression of various proinflammatory genes and also serve as the critical mediator for inflammatory response. Meanwhile, the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway occurs through a handful of TNF receptor superfamily members. Since the activation of this pathway involves protein synthesis, the kinetics of non-canonical NF-κB activation is slow but persistent, in concordance with its biological functions in the development of immune cell and lymphoid organ, immune homeostasis and immune response. The activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway is tightly controlled, highlighting the vital roles of ubiquitination in these pathways. Emerging studies indicate that dysregulated NF-κB activity causes inflammation-related diseases as well as cancers, and NF-κB has been long proposed as the potential target for therapy of diseases. This review attempts to summarize our current knowledge and updates on the mechanisms of NF-κB pathway regulation and the potential therapeutic application of inhibition of NF-κB signaling in cancer and inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods are achieving ever-increasing performance on many artificial intelligence tasks. A major limitation of deep models is that they are not amenable to interpretability. This limitation can be circumvented by developing post hoc techniques to explain the predictions, giving rise to the area of explainability. Recently, explainability of deep models on images and texts has achieved significant progress. In the area of graph data, graph neural networks (GNNs) and their explainability are experiencing rapid developments. However, there is neither a unified treatment of GNN explainability methods, nor a standard benchmark and testbed for evaluations. In this survey, we provide a unified and taxonomic view of current GNN explainability methods. Our unified and taxonomic treatments of this subject shed lights on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and set the stage for further methodological developments. To facilitate evaluations, we generate a set of benchmark graph datasets specifically for GNN explainability. We summarize current datasets and metrics for evaluating GNN explainability. Altogether, this work provides a unified methodological treatment of GNN explainability and a standardized testbed for evaluations.},

Existing methods invariably focus on explaining the importance of graph nodes or edges but ignore the substructures of graphs, which are more intuitive and human-intelligible. In this work, we propose a novel method, known as SubgraphX, to explain GNNs by identifying important subgraphs. Given a trained GNN model and an input graph, our SubgraphX explains its predictions by efficiently exploring different subgraphs with Monte Carlo tree search. To make the tree search more effective, we propose to use Shapley values as a measure of subgraph importance, which can also capture the interactions among different subgraphs. To expedite computations, we propose efficient approximation schemes to compute Shapley values for graph data. Our work represents the first attempt to explain GNNs via identifying subgraphs explicitly and directly. Experimental results show that our SubgraphX achieves significantly improved explanations, while keeping computations at a reasonable level.},

  abstract = {Attributed graph clustering is challenging as it requires joint modelling of graph structures and node attributes. Recent progress on graph convolutional networks has proved that graph convolution is effective in combining structural and content information, and several recent methods based on it have achieved promising clustering performance on some real attributed networks. However, there is limited understanding of how graph convolution affects clustering performance and how to properly use it to optimize performance for different graphs. Existing methods essentially use graph convolution of a fixed and low order that only takes into account neighbours within a few hops of each node, which underutilizes node relations and ignores the diversity of graphs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive graph convolution method for attributed graph clustering that exploits high-order graph convolution to capture global cluster structure and adaptively selects the appropriate order for different graphs. We establish the validity of our method by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Empirical results show that our method compares favourably with state-of-the-art methods.},

We then provide a comprehensive overview of these methods in a systematic manner mainly by following their development history. We also analyze the differences and compositions of different methods.

However, current neural-message passing architectures typically need to perform an expensive recursive neighborhood expansion in multiple rounds and consequently suffer from a scalability issue. Moreover, most existing neural-message passing schemes are inflexible since they are restricted to fixed-hop neighborhoods and insensitive to the actual demands of different nodes. We circumvent these limitations by a novel feature-message passing framework, called Graph Multi-layer Perceptron (GMLP), which separates the neural update from the message passing. With such separation, GMLP significantly improves the scalability and efficiency by performing the message passing procedure in a pre-compute manner, and is flexible and adaptive in leveraging node feature messages over various levels of localities. We further derive novel variants of scalable GNNs under this framework to achieve the best of both worlds in terms of performance and efficiency. We conduct extensive evaluations on 11 benchmark datasets, including large-scale datasets like ogbn-products and an industrial dataset, demonstrating that GMLP achieves not only the state-of-art performance, but also high training scalability and efficiency.},

Then, three representative tasks are proposed based on the three levels of structural information that can be learned by GNNs: node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. Meanwhile, according to the specific applications for various omics data, we categorize and discuss the related studies in three aspects: disease prediction, drug discovery, and biomedical imaging. Based on the analysis, we provide an outlook on the shortcomings of current studies and point out their developing prospect. Although GNNs have achieved excellent results in many biological tasks at present, they still face challenges in terms of low-quality data processing, methodology, and interpretability and have a long road ahead.

  abstract = {Representation learning in heterogeneous graphs aims to pursue a meaningful vector representation for each node so as to facilitate downstream applications such as link prediction, personalized recommendation, node classification, etc. This task, however, is challenging not only because of the demand to incorporate heterogeneous structural (graph) information consisting of multiple types of nodes and edges, but also due to the need for considering heterogeneous attributes or contents (e.g., text or image) associated with each node. Despite a substantial amount of effort has been made to homogeneous (or heterogeneous) graph embedding, attributed graph embedding as well as graph neural networks, few of them can jointly consider heterogeneous structural (graph) information as well as heterogeneous contents information of each node effectively. In this paper, we propose HetGNN, a heterogeneous graph neural network model, to resolve this issue. Specifically, we first introduce a random walk with restart strategy to sample a fixed size of strongly correlated heterogeneous neighbors for each node and group them based upon node types. Next, we design a neural network architecture with two modules to aggregate feature information of those sampled neighboring nodes. The first module encodes "deep" feature interactions of heterogeneous contents and generates content embedding for each node. The second module aggregates content (attribute) embeddings of different neighboring groups (types) and further combines them by considering the impacts of different groups to obtain the ultimate node embedding. Finally, we leverage a graph context loss and a mini-batch gradient descent procedure to train the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that HetGNN can outperform state-of-the-art baselines in various graph mining tasks, i.e., link prediction, recommendation, node classification \& clustering and inductive node classification \& clustering.},

Current approaches designed for hypergraphs, however, are unable to handle different types of hypergraphs and are typically not generic for various learning tasks. Indeed, models that can predict variable-sized heterogeneous hyperedges have not been available. Here we develop a new self-attention based graph neural network called Hyper-SAGNN applicable to homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs with variable hyperedge sizes. We perform extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including four benchmark network datasets and two single-cell Hi-C datasets in genomics. We demonstrate that Hyper-SAGNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on traditional tasks while also achieving great performance on a new task called outsider identification. Hyper-SAGNN will be useful for graph representation learning to uncover complex higher-order interactions in different applications.},

Here, we report Higashi, a new algorithm that enables robust analysis of scHi-C data based on hypergraph representation learning. Extensive evaluation and integrative analysis demonstrate that Higashi significantly outperforms existing methods for embedding and imputation of scHi-C data. Higashi is uniquely able to reveal multiscale 3D genome features (such as compartmentalization and TAD-like domain boundaries), allowing markedly refined analysis of structure and function connections at single-cell resolution. We show that Higashi can also be applied to the recently developed single-cell co-assays that jointly profile scHi-C and additional epigenomic features.

  abstract = {Measuring the semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is an essential step in functional bioinformatics research. We implemented a software named GOGO for calculating the semantic similarity between GO terms. GOGO has the advantages of both information-content-based and hybrid methods, such as Resnik’s and Wang’s methods. Moreover, GOGO is relatively fast and does not need to calculate information content (IC) from a large gene annotation corpus but still has the advantage of using IC. This is achieved by considering the number of children nodes in the GO directed acyclic graphs when calculating the semantic contribution of an ancestor node giving to its descendent nodes. GOGO can calculate functional similarities between genes and then cluster genes based on their functional similarities. Evaluations performed on multiple pathways retrieved from the saccharomyces genome database (SGD) show that GOGO can accurately and robustly cluster genes based on functional similarities. We release GOGO as a web server and also as a stand-alone tool, which allows convenient execution of the tool for a small number of GO terms or integration of the tool into bioinformatics pipelines for large-scale calculations. GOGO can be freely accessed or downloaded from http://dna.cs.miami.edu/GOGO/.},

  abstract = {Node classification is an important research topic in graph learning. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance of node classification. However, existing GNNs address the problem where node samples for different classes are balanced; while for many real-world scenarios, some classes may have much fewer instances than others. Directly training a GNN classifier in this case would under-represent samples from those minority classes and result in sub-optimal performance. Therefore, it is very important to develop GNNs for imbalanced node classification. However, the work on this is rather limited. Hence, we seek to extend previous imbalanced learning techniques for i.i.d data to the imbalanced node classification task to facilitate GNN classifiers. In particular, we choose to adopt synthetic minority oversampling algorithms, as they are found to be the most effective and stable. This task is non-trivial, as previous synthetic minority oversampling algorithms fail to provide relation information for newly synthesized samples, which is vital for learning on graphs. Moreover, node attributes are high-dimensional. Directly over-sampling in the original input domain could generates out-of-domain samples, which may impair the accuracy of the classifier. We propose a novel framework, GraphSMOTE, in which an embedding space is constructed to encode the similarity among the nodes. New samples are synthesize in this space to assure genuineness. In addition, an edge generator is trained simultaneously to model the relation information, and provide it for those new samples. This framework is general and can be easily extended into different variations. The proposed framework is evaluated using three different datasets, and it outperforms all baselines with a large margin.},

  abstract = {Background: Standard graphs, where each edge links two nodes, have been extensively used to represent the connectivity of metabolic networks. It is based on this representation that properties of metabolic networks, such as hierarchical and small-world structures, have been elucidated and null models have been proposed to derive biological organization hypotheses. However, these graphs provide a simplistic model of a metabolic network’s connectivity map, since metabolic reactions often involve more than two reactants. In other words, this map is better represented as a hypergraph. Consequently, a question that naturally arises in this context is whether these properties truly reflect biological organization or are merely an artifact of the representation. Results: In this paper, we address this question by reanalyzing topological properties of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli under a hypergraph representation, as well as standard graph abstractions. We find that when clustering is properly defined for hypergraphs and subsequently used to analyze metabolic networks, the scaling of clustering, and thus the hierarchical structure hypothesis in metabolic networks, become unsupported. Moreover, we find that incorporating the distribution of reaction sizes into the null model further weakens the support for the scaling patterns. Conclusions: These results combined suggest that the reported scaling of the clustering coefficients in the metabolic graphs and its specific power coefficient may be an artifact of the graph representation, and may not be supported when biochemical reactions are atomically treated as hyperedges. This study highlights the implications of the way a biological system is represented and the null model employed on the elucidated properties, along with their support, of the system.},

  abstract = {The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions. However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug–drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity.Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein–protein interactions, drug–protein target interactions and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug–drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug–drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69\%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.Source code and preprocessed datasets are at: http://snap.stanford.edu/decagon.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} One of the major challenges in precision medicine is accurate prediction of individual patient’s response to drugs. A great number of computational methods have been developed to predict compounds activity using genomic profiles or chemical structures, but more exploration is yet to be done to combine genetic mutation, gene expression, and cheminformatics in one machine learning model. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We presented here a novel deep-learning model that integrates gene expression, genetic mutation, and chemical structure of compounds in a multi-task convolutional architecture. We applied our model to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets. We selected relevant cancer-related genes based on oncology genetics database and L1000 landmark genes, and used their expression and mutations as genomic features in model training. We obtain the cheminformatics features for compounds from PubChem or ChEMBL. Our finding is that combining gene expression, genetic mutation, and cheminformatics features greatly enhances the predictive performance. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} We implemented an extended Graph Neural Network for molecular graphs and Convolutional Neural Network for gene features. With the employment of multi-tasking and self-attention functions to monitor the similarity between compounds, our model outperforms recently published methods using the same training and testing datasets.},
